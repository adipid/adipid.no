[Playdate] is a tiny handheld gaming system, with a 1-bit screen and a physical
crank. It's made by [Panic], the same developers that are known for their editor
[Nova], and their FTP-client [Transmit].

I'm reviewing this because it's such an interesting product. One of the reasons
why I bought one was because [Lucas Pope] was making his next game for it, as an
exclusive.

## Design and build quality

The whole thing is tiny yellow brick that only weighs 86 grams. It weighs less
than a [Flipper Zero]. In my honest opinion, it looks fantastic and it feels
very nice in the hand, even for its small size.

The build quality also feels great, it's built with quality materials and feels
like a solid product that will last.

When it comes to ergonomics both for short and long sessions, it feels nice, but
that mostly depends on the games you are playing. If the game is very
"crank-heavy", it can become more tiresome after 15 minutes or so. But overall,
it's still very much enjoyable.

## Display and audio

This is where the Playdate is super unique, it has a 1-bit display with a
resolution of 400 Ã— 240 pixels. Since it's a 1-bit display it looks super sharp,
is really pleasant to look at. However, there is no backlight. That can be a
drawback for some, but I didn't miss that much. If you are in a decently lit
room it should be fairly easy to see whats on the display.

There is a built-in mono speaker which also sounds great, and for all the games
that I've played it has been very decently sounding audio. I haven't tried the
headphone jack, but it's there if you need it.

## Performance and hardware

I'm not familiar with what the specs mean, because I have no experience with
megahertz (MHz), but it has a 168 MHz Cortex M7 CPU, 16 MB of RAM, 8 kB cache
and 4 GB flash storage.

In terms of performance every game that I've tried has been running flawlessly.
It doesn't heat up and there is no fan. I can't say that I have experienced any
form for lag other than opening and closing games/apps feels like it takes one
second too much because the UI doesn't give you any indication of what happens.
And there doesn't seem to be a way to have mulitple apps open, but that can be
due to hardware limitations.

The advertised battery life is 8 hours of active use and 14 days standby clock.
I haven't experienced neither, but I haven't played it for 8 hours straight.
There has always been a few days in between, so the standby battery life hasn't
been true for me either. But it charges relatively fast, in a couple of hours it
can go from 0% to 100%.

## Software and user interface

There is an amazing animation as the [first introduction] when you power on the
Playdate, which immediately gave me much confidence that this can be a quality
product. After that I was very impressed with how the UI looked and worked.
There is a limited amount of buttons, so the UI is limited in that regard, but I
have nothing bad to say about it. It looks and feels really polished, and it
reminded me of my first [Game Boy Color], but much better.

The settings on the Playdate is straight forward, you can manage your games,
Wi-Fi, lock screen and much more. There isn't much customizability you can do to
the UI other than having your games/apps on the home screen displayed as a list
or cards.

My Playdate came pre-loaded with two games, I think, [Whitewater Wipeout] and
[Casual Birder]. And what I didn't know when I bought the Playdate was that it
included a "season", where I get two new games very week for 12 weeks. I haven't
even been able to try them all, but all of them are very different and unique.
It's really cool.

The system update process is straight forward, even with a cool UI for it.

## Gaming experience

Like I mentioned in [Software and user interface](#software-and-user-interface),
you get 24 games for free over 12 weeks, but there is also a [seperate store]
where you can buy additional games and apps. And there is a huuuge varaity of
games.

[seperate store]: https://play.date/games

I have bought the following games:

- [Mars after midnight](https://play.date/games/mars-after-midnight/)
- [Pullfrog Playdate Deluxe](https://play.date/games/pullfrog/)
- [Soko](https://play.date/games/soko/)
- [A joke that's worth $ 0.99](https://play.date/games/a-joke-thats-worth-99c/)
- [Eyeland](https://play.date/games/eyeland/)

For all of the games that I've played the gaming experience has been excellent.
And like I mentioned in [Performance and hardware](#performance-and-hardware),
the performance has been good. The controls and responsiveness has been very
good, and especially the crank has been cool, but I found that that depends
entirely on the game. Some games doesn't utilize the crank at all and that's
fine.

## Connectivity and additional features

It uses USB-C to charge and connect to the computer.

There is Wi-Fi on the Playdate, and it's been reliable. However, typing in a
long, secure password wasn't so fun, but you are not supposed to type on the
thing all the time anyway.

And the Wi-Fi isn't a requirement after the initial setup, so the device works
perfectly offline. I have been using it during travels and I have only connected
it to my home Wi-Fi.

One thing to consider is that it seems that you have to have an account to even
use the Playdate. And I have written about my distaste for requiring accounts
[before](/blog/arc-browser-account), but here I feel like it makes sense,
especially for the initial setup.

You can download [Panic]'s [Mirror app] so that you can mirror what you play on
the Playdate on a bigger screen. It's available on all platforms.

## Pricing

The Playdate costs $199 excluding taxes. To me that doesn't seem to much
considering how great of a product you get for that price and there are 24
unique games included in that price. However, I don't have any other products to
compare it to.

## Pros and cons

| Pros                                                               | Cons                                                            |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small and nostalgic.                                               | Battery life, it hasn't lived up to the advertised time for me. |
| Simple design, hardware and software.                              | The crank feels underutilized.                                  |
| Good value when it comes to hardware and software including games. |                                                                 |
| Great build quality.                                               |                                                                 |
| Flawless gaming experience in terms of performance.                |                                                                 |

## Conclusion

TL;DR I recommend the Playdate to those who want to play games that remind them
of the old days of small(ish) handhelds but with todays polish and love.

The Playdate is an interesting little device which I feel like keeps giving me
new stuff every time I pick it up, but that might stop after having it for 12
weeks. But nonetheless, there is a great catalog of games and upcoming games.

I'm looking forward to see what else [Panic] has in store (pun intended) for the
future, so I guess I will update my RSS reader with their [Playdate News].

What do you guys think? Have you tried the Playdate or are you planning/waiting
to buy one?
