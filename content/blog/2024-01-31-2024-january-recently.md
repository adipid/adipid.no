And here we are again, January is over. Let's have a look at what went down this
month!

I sold my Valve Index. No more VR for me, but I don't really have the time nor
enough space to set it up each time I want to play a quick session. And now
someone else can enjoy the fun!

I've been reading more blogs lately ([feedroll](/logs/feedroll)). It's fun to
get other people's perspective on stuff, in general.

## 💪 Health

Started the year sick, but I managed to get through it quickly and have been
running semi-regulary!

Ran another race, half-marathon, on the 20th. It was snowy and icy, lots of fun!

## 🧑‍💻 Development

I haven't done much work on the website this month. Only a few bugfixes here and
there. I do still have stuff on my [todo](/todo), but nothing that requires
immediate attention.

I have however managed to sneak in some time to try out Rust, not very much, but
enough to say that I want to explore it more. I'm thinking about making a
[Hima](https://sr.ht/~timharek/hima/)-CLI, and maybe a new API for it. We'll
see.

And I managed to move everything from my old VPS on 1984 Hosting over to a new
VPS from the same service. I had done some bad stuff where I hadn't made
everything reproducible with configs. So now my new VPS is only set up using
Ansible, and hopefully it stays that way!

[SourceHut](https://sourcehut.org/), my sourceforge of choice, had a major
[outage this month](https://sourcehut.org/blog/2024-01-19-outage-post-mortem/),
and was down for a couple of days due to a big DDoS-attack. I was impressed on
how well the managed to handle the situation and how much stuff they had
prepared.

## 🎬 Entertainment

We started the year by watching a bunch of movies. I came across a YouTube-video
about the best movies of 2023, and I put all of them on my watchlist. We only
have a couple left.

### TV

- **What if? S2** – The Marvel cartoon lived up to the hype. I enjoy the
  alternate stuff and the new characters they introduced!
- **Echo S1** – Another Marvel show! I liked this one, reminded me a bit of
  Daredevil, but some of the action and story was very weird. Felt a bit rushed,
  but it was enjoyable.
- **Reacher S2** – This was great. The story was meh, but the acting and the
  main characters banter is very entertaining.

We're still watching **Succession S4**, but now it feels like a chore 😅
Hopefully we'll finish it in February so we can move on! We also started to
watch **The Curse S1**, I don't know how to describe it...

### Movie

- **BlackBerry (2023)** – Great movie! I thought I knew some of the history, but
  I learned a lot and it was a fun way of learning the history of BlackBerry.
- **The Holdovers (2023)** – We actully watched this movie from New Years Eve
  into New Years day. Excellent movie and performances. Touching story.
- **The Creator (2023)** – Dissapointing. I had high expectaions to this because
  a lot of critics were praising the movie. But the only thing I really liked
  was the setting and the design of the robots.
- **Saltburn (2023)** – WTF.
- **Office Space (1999)** – Fun and relevant movie.
- **Månelyst i Flåklypa (2018)** – Great Norwegian stop-motion movie! We had a
  great time.
- **May December (2023)** – Again, high expectations. It was fine.
- **Cocaine Bear (2023)** – Fun movie, but nothing more nothing less.
