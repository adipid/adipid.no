Not a whole lot has happend this month. Been spending a lot of time with family,
and I have focued more on getting a proper routine again after our newborn came
into this world.

## üí™ Health

This month I have been running three times a week on average and I have had an
average of 70 minutes of walking and running this month. I'm quite satisified
with that.

I also ran another race this month, a half-marathon. I managed to finish on 2
hours and 6 minutes. My end-of-year goal is 2 hours, and the next race is
December 2nd, so if I keep up the good work I will get there!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Tech

As of writing I can't say that I have done a lot of development as of late. I
have helped out [friByte](https://fribyte.no) with their website for their
upcoming open source conference, [boskonf](https://boskonf.no).

I did come across a
[random blogpost](https://dannb.org/blog/2023/how-kagi-beats-google/) about a
new search engine, [Kagi](https://kagi.com). It made me curious enough to try
Kagi for a whole day. And I did actually end up switching from DuckduckGo to
Kagi. I have been using Kagi for about a week and I even pay for the thing, and
I'm so impressed with it! It has some really nice features that can summaries a
URL, video, podcast etc. and it can also summaries a search query to give you a
quick answer.

## üé¨ Entertainment

### TV

- **Ashoka S1** ‚Äì It was fun Star Wars show. I enjoyed the characters and the
  story it's setting up!
- **Succession S2** ‚Äì This family is something else. Great drama, great actors!

### Movie

Only watched one movie this month, **Promising Young Woman**. Excellent movie.
It was eerie and funny at the same time, and the acting performances was really
good.
