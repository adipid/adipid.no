I got a new keyboard last week, [ZSA's Voyager]. It's a low-profile
split-keyboard with 52 keys.

I got my first split-keyboard in March 2022, I bought one after reading a cool
post [about a dude that ended up with a 42 keys-keyboards on
Kode24][kode24-post]. Like the author, I ended up buying ZSA's Moonlander. It
was a big and bulky keyboard, but it was really nice to type on. And it looked
cool!

As of today I have used the Voyager for six days, and wow was the first couple
of days rough! When I got the keyboard I wasn't prepared for just how small it
was, and how few keys there were.

After spending more than two years getting accustomed to my Moonlander's layout,
I now had to change to a smaller and simpler layout.

You can checkout my [Moonlander layout], and my [Voyager layout].

The one thing I missed the most was having ESC available on my right hands
pointing-finger. But those days are gone, I have now converted back to having
ESC in the top-left corner like most ordinary keyboards. I had to move all of my
modifier keys, except my favorite Ctrl, that had always been a long-pressed Z.

It feels like I'm complaining, but I'm really not! Or, I was whining about
having less keys and having to move stuff around. But I was the one that
actually bought the expensive keyboard. Like I mentioned earlier, the first
couple of days were rough. I had to break and build new habits and
muscle-memories, and boy did I do a lot of short 15 seconds tests on
[Monkeytype]. When I got to about 100 words-per-minute (my old average was 118)
I took a break from testing myself and did something else. I did this for four
days, and now the keyboard feels more familiar.

But why did I buy this thing? Well, I didn't tell you earlier, but I actually
had two Moonlanders (I sold my first one this week). I had one for my
home-office and one in my workplace. It became cumbersome to move my primary
keyboard around with me every day and adjust the legs. And ZSA's founder was
recently on [Changelog's podcast], and their story was so good. It made me want
to try their new Voyager keyboard. It gave me the nudge and excuse I need to try
something new! And maybe I could not have to have two of the same keyboards.
Hopefully someone wants to buy my last Moonlander.

My goal with this post is to push myself to write a proper review for the
Voyager, because I already have some thoughts. And maybe it can help someone
that's one the fence for buying it, or someone buying a split-keyboard in
general.

Also, checkout [ZSA's blog], it's really cool!
