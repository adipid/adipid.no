Last year I started renovating my apartment, I had to buy a lot of stuff and I
wanted to document every purchase and keep a digital copy of all the receipts.
One way I could do that would be by taking a photo of all the receipts whenever
I made a new purchase, however, that would just end up accumulating a lot of
unnecessary space on my device(s).

A photo-copy, from your phone is usually 10x larger than it needs to be. Do you
really need a copy of your recent receipt that has a resolution of 3024x4032 px?
If the photo is not compressed it could end up taking up toward 5 MB, and that
is waaaaay to big. It's a waste of space, and it could make indexing the receipt
more difficult.

Nowadays modern phones, both Android and iPhones comes with a document scanner
built-in. On iPhone (which I use) you can scan documents via the _Files_-app,
and it works great! It detects the document and makes a scan as soon as it's
finished scanning its contents. It's also super convienient on iOS's
Nextcloud-app.

(I don't have an Android phone available to test, but it seems it's possible to
scan documents straight from [the camera app][android], please do that instead
of taking a 5 MB photo.)

From the example above, a photo of my notebook took about 6.7 MB vs the scan
which took 465 kB.

By doing this I can save a lot of space on my devices, which is both good for
the environment and my wallet, as I don't need buy more storage to keep photos
of documents and receipts. And now, for some documents, you get [OCR][ocr]
support, which means you can search through the newly scanned document as a PDF.
And one last benefit, you don't clutter up your photos app with lots of random
photos of documents.

## TL;DR

- You save space on your devices.
- You can get OCR support on your scans.
- It's better for the environment.
- Less clutter in the photos app.
