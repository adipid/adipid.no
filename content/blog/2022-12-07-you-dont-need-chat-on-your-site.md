More and more website has started adding "Live chat" to their websites. It
usually says something along the lines of:

> Hi! My name is Blah Blah, let me know if I can help you...

Or it can try to sell you something:

> Hi! We are running this bad campaign for something you don't need...

And almost every time I see this "nagging" I want to leave the website. It
reminds me of going to a clothing store and before I'm able to get inside an
employee asks me if I need help finding anything. The difference here is that
the employee is able to be nice about it when I kindly say I'm just browsing,
but the "Live chat" usually reminds me every time I load a new page.

When I go to shop online I can't think of a reason why I go to a website and
want to talk to someone in a "_live_" chat, that isn't even live ðŸ˜… I want to
find the items I need and move on with my day. If I need assistance, I will most
likely do one of the following:

- Find a support e-mail.
- Go to a physical store.
- Ask a friend.
- See if I find an unintrusive live chat that I chose to enable.

So if you need to have a "Live chat" on your website, you probably need to do
something about your website's content, because most likely people are having a
hard time finding what they're looking for. Your website should solve a problem
for your visitors, not add more.
