Milestones, side-projects, running, furniture-making and so on. A bunch of
different things happened in April. Wait, spring is almost over ‚Äì time flies! ü™∞

Two new posts this month:

- [I switched from Wireguard to headscale]
- [How to use git-cliff on SourceHut]

## üçÄ Life

Our daughter has had lots of milestones this month and it brings us so much joy!
She's happy and healthy!

We got a lot of clothes passed down to our daughter, and since I'm on paternal
leave I have been washing and organizing everything. And boy does baby-clothes
take up a lot of space. But I have a solution, reusable vacuum-sealed bags!
Since we got all of the clothes disorganized, I organized everything into vacuum
bags with labels of the sizes. This makes it much simpler to pass the clothes
further on in the future.

I made outdoor furniture! Outdoor furniture is so expensive, and we will only
use it maybe for 14‚Äì21 days every year and we had a building supply warehouse
open nearby ‚Äì so I headed there on opening day and bought some supplies. And now
we have homemade outdoor sitting bench. I want to make more!

## üí™ Health

I ran another half-marathon race, finished in 2 hours and 4 minutes, almost beat
my personal record, missed by two minutes. Been keeping up the running since, I
don't have a regular routine as the baby-life is a bit unpredicatable ‚Äì but that
is totally fine!

And we bought a second-hand baby/child-carrier (b√¶remeis) and we've been going
on more walks, and it seems like our daughter is loving it! So much to see
instead of just sleeping in a stroller when we go for walks. I also enjoy it
more, it feels more like proper exercise üí™

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

There is an upcoming "edition" of [Kaizen] for the website coming up, but for
everything else I have managed to contribute a bit more to [NRSS] and done some
more QOL improvements and also helped think of how the project can cache
requests instead of doing a GET-request to the NRK-endpoints every time someone
wants to listen to a podcast episode.

I have been making good progress on my "logs"-project, something new I tried
with this project is to have tests for 99% and it has made refactoring and
bugfixing so much faster. Hopefully it will make the project easier to maintain
and easier for others to contribute as well. I'm hoping to have something to
show before the summer.

Another thing I've done this month is update most of
[my Deno modules](/projects?tag=deno), mostly adding more tests and [Zod] to
make debugging and JSON-schema validation easier and faster. I also released
`v1.0` of [Filmpolitiet API], it now has proper pagination, an RSS-feed and
built-in tests. It's also available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/timharek/filmpolitiet-api).

## üé¨ Entertainment

No new movies this month, we've been busy watching some awesome TV shows!

- **Tokyo Vice S1** ‚Äì The setting, acting, characters and much more is so
  interesting. I knew of the yakzua from before, but not like this.
- **Tokyo Vice S2** ‚Äì Same as S1, and but the acting in this season really
  escalated for everyone involved. Sato was our favorite.
- **Invincible S2** ‚Äì Finally! This season had so much going on and the finale
  didn't end on a cliffhanger, but the other episodes makes waiting for S3 even
  more painful! I might just buy the comics.
- **Fallout S1** ‚Äì This is one of the best video-game adaptations I've seen.
  They nailed the world, characters and the weirdness of everything. I have been
  thinking about this show for the last two weeks, I want more!
- **Sh≈çgun S1** ‚Äì Japan was a sureal place during the samurai-era. Every episode
  was able to keep us invested because how the characters were doubling crossing
  each other all of the place and performing seppuku seemed like it was just
  part of the every day.

All of the shows this month was 5 out of 5 stars, that must be a first! I highly
recommend watching all of them.

## üåê Links

- [Fuck trees, use tags] ‚Äì Tags makes stuff more organized.
- [Computers + internet + me != three] ‚Äì I had the same reflection when it came
  to the fediverse, and that is one of the reasons why I ended up leaving. I
  enjoy living without it.
- [What makes a great technical blog] ‚Äì Simple points, but also very effective!
- [Imperfections create connections] ‚Äì Imperfections makes stuff worth it.
- [Papyrus 2 (video)] ‚Äì Fantastic sequel!
- [Humane AI ‚Äì Pico Laser Projection ‚Äì $230M AI Twist on an Old Scam] ‚Äì Always
  thought the Ai Pin was weird, not in terms of design, but what is was made
  for. If I want to use my phone less and still stay connected I use my
  smartwatch, not saying this is the best option for everyone ‚Äì but it has a
  screen and works without a cocky AI.
- [Hardest Problem in Computer Science: Centering Things] ‚Äì Nothing is centered.
  It cannot be unseen.
- [Why you need a "WTF Notebook"] ‚Äì Keep a notebook of WTFs around, just in
  case.
- [Fixing up Git with Autosquash] ‚Äì A workflow I wasn't aware of, definetly
  going to start to use this! No more fixing fixes!
- [Matt Crawford - Manual Competence (video)] ‚Äì Great keynote about how manual
  labour is important for giving ourselves ownership over our materialistic
  world. Not doing it makes us helpless and dependent of others. And also,
  washing machines has too much electronics.
- [jameschensmith/awesome-website-paths] ‚Äì A cool list of awesome paths we
  should use!

See you next month, same time ‚Äì same place!
