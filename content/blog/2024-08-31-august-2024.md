This time I'm writing my update from the airport in Amsterdam, on our way home
from a wedding aborad (and it's delayed)!

## 🍀 Life

The month started off with everyone back at the office after the summer break,
and I started two weeks earlier than everyone else to get a head start after my
paternal leave. It's been fun getting back to work again!

Our daughter turned one year old this month, and like all other parents, we
can't believe how time flies. And she also started kindergarten this month, and
she has been enjoying it.

And as I'm writing this we, my SO and I, are on our way back from a wedding
aboard from friends of ours that live in Belfast. I first met the couple online
after playing Overwatch almost 8 years ago, and here we are! It was a blast, and
we can finally check off having been to a Irish-wedding!

The week before the wedding I was invited to a bachleors-party celebration for
another friend of mine, and we headed to Spain for four days. The last two weeks
has been really something!

## 💪 Health

On the day of our daughters birthday-party I attended another half-marathon
race, which is in the woods on gravel. It was not like how I had pictured it at
all, there were so many steep hills and slopes, and we had to run four laps. It
took me 2:25:51 with over 400 meters elevation. I was tired afterwards.

I signed up for a 10k race in September in the city that I'm exictied for, not
that I have been able to run so much the last two weeks because of travel and
other excuses... But I'm excited nonetheless!

## 🧑‍💻 Development

I finished, or I have a working version of the wedding webapp I mentioned last
month. I hope to open source it at a later date when I have made it more generic
with less hard-codinged aspects. But it's a functioning webapp where you can
RSVP for one or multiple guests in a cohort, view the guestlist as the bride and
groom, add and remove guests etc. It's all made using Deno, Fresh and SQLite.

A coworker of mine asked/challenged me to try Go, so I have been writing a bit
of Go this month and I like it! Hopefully I'm able to spend a bit more time next
month learning my ways around the language. And we're also trying out Go for a
project at work also, to see how it compares to our usual tech-stack.

## 🎬 Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **Deadpool & Wolverine (2024)** – Rewatched it with my SO.
- **Twisters (2024)** – Suspensful movie! Enjoyed it very much, not sure how
  realistic it was, but nonetheless.
- **30 Minutes or Less (2011)** – Easy watch, and a rewatch from many moons ago.

### TV

- **House of the Dragon S2** – Slow season, the acting and world-building was
  fantastic!
- **Game of Thrones S2** – Rewatching the whole show. I find the world and
  characters more and more interesting!
- **Pantheon S2** – Slow start, but great ending!
- **Game of Thrones S3** – Rewatch! And now the fun begins!

- [Removing stuff is never obvious yet often better] – I see why this would
  work, I like to think that I have sometimes raised my hand and asked "do we
  need this?" and/or "what if we remove this?". This is a good reminder to try
  to subtract before we think about adding more.
- [Software estimates have never worked and never will] – IMO doesn’t this apply
  to all kinds of software. And you could say the same thing about other
  industries as well.
