Trying out a new layout for these, please bear with me.

## üå≥ Life

I missed August's post because I went on vacation. We went to visit family in
Thailand for a couple of weeks. It was great being able to just relax and do
nothing.

## üñ® 3D-printing

I've been hard at work learning more about my 3D-printer. I printed a bunch of
spool-holders for all my filament, which is mounted nicely on a IKEA Sk√•dis
pegboard besides the printer.

I also bought a glass plate to replace the metal bed to get better prints. _Why
is this so much fun?_

## üéÆ Gaming

While on vacation I brought my Steam Deck, which was just amazing. Almost all of
my Steam-library on such a small handheld device. I played a bunch of Disco
Elysium, but a game that really stood out was **Return of Obra Dinn**, it was so
much fun! I felt like a true detective, and it performed excellent on my Deck!
Highly recommend!

## üí™ Health

I went back to my Apple Watch when I got back from vacation, after not using it
[since January][dumb_watch]. I hadn't been exercising as much as I wanted to and
thought maybe I could motivate myself more again. This time I turned of all
notifications except calls and SMS. So far it has worked out great, I've been
more active. And I bought the new **Apple Watch Ultra**, which has been great in
terms of battery-life and performance. I really like the new _action button_,
it's so convenient!

## üìö Reading

Currently reading [The Phoenix Project][phoenix_project], it was recommended by
a colleague. I've read half of it by now and I really like it, everything that
can go wrong goes wrong! I think I'm learning a few new things as well while
reading it. Might do a proper review of the book when I finish, we'll see!

## üåê Interwebs

I deleted my last social media account, on a Mastodon instance. I joined
February last year. It was fun in the beginning, but it eventually become to
much and didn't bring any joy anymore. Started to get frustrated every time I
logged in just to check what people had been up to. So I just deleted the thing,
no more feeling the urge to check-in.
