ZSA Voyager is a low-profile split-keyboard with 52 keys that is built with
open-source firmware, hot-swappable keys and more.

After using [ZSA Voyager] for more than [two months](/blog/new-keyboard-who-dis)
I think I have what I need to give a proper review of this thing.

## Hardware

The keyboard is split into two "islands" (or halves), that each weigh 217 grams.
There are 52-keys in total on the whole keyboard. It's made out of metal with
plastic keycaps. It comes with four magnet feet that attach on one side of each
"island" to give it a tent position. ZSA also includes three USB-C cables of
varying lengths and a single TRRS cable for connecting the "islands".

It feels very compact when comparing to regular keyboards, or my previous [ZSA
Moonlander MK1]. The build-quality feels great, it's sturdy with absolutely no
visible flex. The "islands" feel premium, considering that they weigh more than
200 grams. I get the impression that the thing will last for a long long time.

Another thing to note is that the keys are columnar, which means each column is
straight, unlike regular keyboards. This wasn't new for me with this keyboard,
but it sure took me a while when I got my first split-keyboard.

The cables feel like regular cables with nothing out of the ordinary to say
other than the shortest 30 cm one has become a bit loose on one end. And that is
only after approximately 10 work weeks where I unplug and plug it in every work
day. But the cable still works and I can get a new one down the line, and I even
have two more included (both are too long for my daily work needs though).

It comes with a carrying case which took me a while to get used to. I have to
fiddle with the TRRS cable every time, because it has to be aligned perfectly so
that the case doesn't bulge. When I get it just right the case feels snug and
slides perfectly in my backpack and takes up much less space than a regular
keyboard (I used to carry around a Keychron K2 before my split-keyboard
adventure). And the metal-plate for the magnets is, how do I put this, superb?
It feels really sturdy and the magnets are very powerful and just snaps to it.
It's very satisfying to snap them on the plate.

And last, but not least, the keyboard is wired. No batteries. You plug it in,
and it just works!

### Ergonomics

This is a tricky subject, because I myself believe that ergonomics is very
individual. I didn't get this keyboard because I have had issues with my hands
or wrists, I got the keyboard because ZSA had piqued my interest with their
design and story to why this keyboard should exist.

However, I have experienced improved comfort when writing, especially for longer
sessions. I write a lot, both text and code, but the keyboard only has 52 keys.
This took me a while to get used to. I was used to two additional rows of keys
on both of the keyboard-islands from my previous Moonlander. Initially I thought
I wasn't going to be able to use this as my daily-driver. But after about 15
different iterations of my layout, I found something that I could use. I go more
into detail in the [Learning curve](#learning-curve)-section

The tenting magnet-feet is my preferred way of using the keyboard. Without them
the keyboard becomes too flat, like a laptop keyboard. It still works, but it's
way more comfortable with the slight tenting.

Positioning the islands is something I really don't think about. But I see that
I usually space them a tiny bit less than my shoulder-width.

### Typing experience

I have the Kalih Choc Brown keys, and they feel similar to regular mechanical
keys. They have less travel, but they have the same feel in my opinion. They
make a bit more sound than someone typing angrily on a laptop keyboard.

ZSA sells the keyboard with Kalih Choc Brown (tactile), Kalih Choc White
(clicky), Kalih Choc Red (linear) and Kalih Choc Pro Red (linear, lighter
touch).

## Configuration and software

This is really where ZSA shines. I can configure absolutely all my keys to be
whatever I want, through their Keyboard Configurator: [Oryx]. And I can even
share [my layout][voyager layout]. It's easy enough to use, and I think most of
their customers won't have problem using Oryx.

After you have created your layout you have to flash it to your keyboard, which
you can either do via a Chromium browser or via their proprietary app [Keymapp].
I don't use Chromium browsers, so I use Keymapp. It's straightforward and just
works, the instructions are excellent with an outline of where the reset/flash
button is on the keyboard.

You can also see the current layout on the keyboard in Keymapp. But a big thing
I'm missing is the ability to do what Oryx does in Keymapp, so that I can do the
entire thing offline and on my device instead of having to rely on ZSA service.
It's a minor thing, but it would go a long way for me, and I'm sure others would
agree as well.

One of the key differences between ZSA's keyboards and others, is that they have
layers. You can configure a "default" layer for your everyday stuff, and a
different layer for media-controls, and one for gaming. This is useful when you
consider how far you have to reach with your hands to the function-row to adjust
the volume, screen brightness etc. on a regular keyboard.

And a minor thing that I don't care about is the RGB/lighting on the keyboard.
You can give an entire layer a color, a single key or both. I haven't used this
too much other than to give modifier keys a color to make them stand out.

## Pricing

This is an expensive piece of computer hardware. It cost me 456.25 USD including
Norwegian taxes to get it. That is 4-5x the price of a regular keyboard, but a
regular keyboard is, well, regular. It's flexes, has weird (or annoying) RGB, is
not customizable etc.

I get that it is hard to justify a purchase like this keyboard, and I have to
admit that I impulsively bought the keyboard after hearing ZSA's founder talk on
a [podcast I listen to](https://changelog.com/podcast/608).

## Learning curve

When starting out with a keyboard with columnar keys, it requires a lot of time
upfront for you to become comfortable writing with it. A goal I always have in
mind when typing on a keyboard, is that I should never have to look down. If I
have to do that, then I need to practice more.

For the Voyager, it was familiar to write on, but my initial impression on a
52-key keyboard was that I doubted that I could use this as my daily-driver.
However like I mentioned earlier (in [Ergonomics](#ergonomics)), after a few
layout changes I found something that I could use. From my Moonlander I had
conditioned myself to use my right pointing-finger to use `ESC`, but this was
"impossible" with the Voyager. I was missing a row of keys. I ended up going
back to having my `ESC`-key at the top left of the left island.

After the first couple of (rough) days I was getting the hang of the keyboard, I
got used to having less keys. I used more modifiers for the modifier-keys like
`Cmd` etc. And to this day I still experiment with new layouts to see if I can
make my life even simpler.

## Who is this keyboard for?

People who:

- Likes to experiment and try new stuff.
- Writes for long durations at the time.
- Wants a quality keyboard.
- Wants less keys, and clutter on their keyboard.

There are probably more use cases.

## Conclusion

I recommend the ZSA Voyager. I'm happy with my purchase, and I enjoy typing on
it every day. I like its design, form-factor and how easy it is to customize. It
is expensive, but if you want great stuff, sometimes you have to pay the price.
