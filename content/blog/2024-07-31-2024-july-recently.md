Paternal leave and summer vacation is over, but here's another update for what
I've been up to since June!

## ‚úçÔ∏è Blogging

I wrote two this month:

- [I received an AI email](/blog/i-received-an-ai-email)
- [I broke my glasses](/blog/i-broke-my-glasses)

One of these posts was posted on Hacker News. I woke up to a message
congratulating me on reaching the frontpage. The message didn't say which
frontpage, but I went on Hacker News and there it was:
<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40862865>

And to my suprise, a lot of people felt the same way about it. That is was
unpersonal and straight up bad. And there was a lot of great discussion about
the issue itself. The discussion was a lot less divided than the
[last time](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33904017).

If you are a new reader because of the recent post, greetings and salutations!

## üçÄ Life

<!-- TODO: What has been going on -->

We started the month with visiting family and friends in my hometown. It was a
busy week! Even managed to sneak in doing some manual maintenence on our car,
with some much appericated family-help!

We also had some family over for a week and it was a lot of fun when I was
supposed to be home alone with our daughter. Time flew by quickly!

And my paternal leave is over! I've been back at work for a week and a half now,
and I see that I've missed working... but I also miss being back home. It's been
a great leave from work, we managed to do a lot stuff and I managed to work on
some side-projects in the downtime.

I'm looking forward to the remainder of the year, new projects at work and I
have a few trips planned as well!

## üí™ Health

It's less than a month until the next race, and I feel great when it comes to my
running routine! After the test last month I feel like I have improved a lot.
It's also much less tiring to run now after I learned about what my pace and
heart-rate should be for getting faster.

I've managed to keep up an average of 20 km running and 10 km biking per week
this last month. It feels great, especially in the summer weather! I want to try
biking to work one day and see how that feels. It's 15 km one way, with a lot of
road-biking without bikelanes. I think I'll try on a Saturday or Sunday, just to
make sure I get home safely.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

I started work on a new project, an API-client for [TheMovieDB] (or TMDb). I
switched all of my [watched-logs] over to TMDb instead of relying on [OMDb].
Right now it's very barebone, but it's enough for my needs. I want to publish it
on JSR when I have something to show.

I also started work on a wedding-invitation app, using Deno, Fresh and SQLite.
That's also veeeeery barebone, but it's functional. Hopefully it will be in a
usable state in the next couple of days. And don't worry, it's not for me ;)

There is an upcoming edition of [Kaizen] coming!

## üé¨ Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **Inside Out (2015)** ‚Äì A fun rewatch!
- **Inside Out 2 (2024)** ‚Äì It felt like too much, not as great as the first
  one.
- **The Zone of Interest (2023)** ‚Äì Too abstract/artsy for me. I like the
  sentiment the movie tells, but it was slow.
- **The Bikeriders (2024)** ‚Äì Cool movie with an interesting setting.
- **Logan (2017)** ‚Äì A rewatch to prepare myself for Deadpool & Wolverine.
- **Deadpool & Wolverine (2024)** ‚Äì Went to the midnight premiere. I wasn't
  expecting this kind of nostaglia trip, having watched almost every single
  Marvel movie since 2000 I wasn't expecting this. It was a lot of fun, awesome
  to see Wolverine an d Deadpool finally interact on the big screen. I did go
  home feeling like this movie almost was self-contained although it's set in
  the MCU.

### TV

- **The Acolyte S1** ‚Äì Cool show. Some of the characters decisions were weird,
  and the flashbacks felt rushed.
- **The Boys S4** ‚Äì Overall I enjoyed this season. Unexpected ending.
- **Game of Thrones S1** ‚Äì Rewatch. It's a lot of fun!
