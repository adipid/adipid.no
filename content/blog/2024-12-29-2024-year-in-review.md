The older I get, the faster time moves. If time feels this fast when I'm 28,
then I can't imagine how fast time moves when I'm 38. 2024 has been a blast, and
now it's soon a blast in the past. Let's dive in to what happened!

## Looking back

### Yearly themes

2024's yearly theme was **Year of Listening**, it involved the following:

- Reduce unsolicited advice
- Listen more actively
- Don't assume
- Ask until I understand
- Ask for feedback

I have gotten better at all of these items, some more than others. The ones I
know I have gotten better at is "ask until I understand" and "ask for feedback".
I have done this both at work and at home with friends and family. And I have
received positive feedback for asking about stuff until I understand them, and
when I have asked someone for their feedback on something I have done.

All of these points however, are something I will continue to strive towards and
have in my toolbelt going forward.

My secondary theme was **Year of reaching out**, and I have reached out to
almost ten blogs, and some have even reached out to me after I wrote my previous
_year in review_. This is something I will continue to do, it has been rewarding
knowing that I have reached out and given feedback and told someone how much I
appreciate their blog and writing.

### Life

I can't believe my daughter is more than one year old. Time flies. I had my
paternal leave where I was [absent from work for 158 days], where I got to spend
lots of quality time with my daughter. We went on a whole lot of walks, both in
a stroller and in a baby carrier.

Our daughter has had a lot of milestones, she started saying words, walking,
saying the names of our pets, started in kindergarten, and so much more. It's
really so fulfilling to see the development of a tiny human, I can't wait for
what's to come!

Other than our daughter, not a whole lot has happened, I have 3D-printed lots of
stuff for our house, kitchen, bathrooms etc. We've been to three weddings (my SO
went to four), where one of them was in Northern Ireland visiting an "online
friend" of 8 years. My brother and I did some manual maintenance on our car. I
went to a bachelors-party in Spain for four days...

### Health

My health has varied a lot in 2024. I've been sick more times than I can count
this year, most likely due to our daughter's kindergarten. I managed to run 5
races this year where 4 of them were half-marathons. My pace has been varying
also, I was in much better shape when I had my paternal leave. That has most
likely something to do with being much more active the whole day in comparison
to my average weekday now.

I started using an iOS-app called Gentler Streak to keep up with all my vitals
and have "tailored" coach to tell me how much I should exercise according to my
activity level. It has worked for the most part, but some days it has been off
and my sleep recording was nothing like what I actually felt. But hey, it can't
tell the future, it can only work with what it has.

### Blogging

Throughout 2024 I have written 34 posts, where 12 of them were my monthly post
about what I've been up, giving us 22 "actual" posts. There hasn't been a
specific theme this year, other than writing about stuff that interests me.

I have written two hardware reviews, [Playdate review] and [ZSA Voyager review].
The idea behind these reviews was for me to really consider all the aspects of
what I bought. To my surprise others have found them helpful and replied via
email to let me know that I convinced them to buy a Playdate or try a split
keyboard.

[ZSA Voyager review]: /blog/zsa-voyager-review

My highlights this year has to be [I received an AI email] and [I broke my
glasses]. The AI email one ended up on Hacker News and I got lots of support for
my frustrations. And about my glasses, I enjoyed the process of having to fix my
glasses with 3D-printing and then get to blog about it.

### Programming and development

I learned a new programming language, Go! I'm super excited for what the future
holds, every time I use Go to solve a problem it feels like I have super-powers,
because all my use-cases has made perfect sense (everything looks like a nail).

#### Projects

When I started to learn Go I did what every sane person would do, [I built a
weather CLI]. I had done so previously in Deno/TypeScript, but with Go it was
different. I have even gotten some friends and coworkers to try it out. Besides
checking the weather with Go, I also created a [Migadu CLI and package] and
[OpenLibrary package] for Go.

[I built a weather CLI]: /blog/i-built-a-weather-cli
[OpenLibrary package]: https://git.sr.ht/~timharek/openlibrary-go
[Migadu CLI and package]: https://sr.ht/~timharek/migadu/

Besides Go, I started a new blog-series, [Kaizen](/tags/kaizen). I haven't
posted anything since June, but don't worry, I don't know when the next entry is
coming either. The series has mostly been about my (this) website and my home
lab. It has given me a place to write more about stuff I don't think should be
their own posts, although in retrospect they probably could, idunno.

#### Website

My website hasn't changed much in 2024, I haven't rewritten it (yet) with a
different framework/language. Instead I have continued to improve the small
stuff and fix bugs. Most of the bugs are self-produced, but they need fixing
nonetheless.

#### Hima

There hasn't been any new features when it comes to Hima, my **Home Inventory
Management Application**. Instead, I have been exploring new stuff and done
research into recreating what I have already made using Go, with a greater focus
on self-hosting and data-ownership.

#### Terminals

Back in August I switched from iTerm2 to WezTerm and loved it! It felt smoother,
it has config-file instead of a GUI. Later, I started seeing people talking
about Ghostty on YouTube and Hashimoto wrote [Ghostty 1.0 is coming]. After
reading that post I knew I had to try out Ghostty when it came out. And here we
are, a few days after it has come out. I have made the switch and I love it more
than WezTerm, Helix is no longer sluggish for large files with lots of
references and links. It feels like a proper native application. I might have to
write a review or a first impressions.

### Entertainment

#### Movies and TV shows

I have watched 40 movies and 33 seasons of TV shows, resulting in approximately
80 hours watching movies and 220 hours watching TV, resulting in 300 hours in
total. Like last year, that's a lot. That's about 3.4 % of the total hours
of 2024.

For the first time in many years I don't have a favorite movie, I never watched
a 5/5 movie in 2024, and I don't have any memorable movie experiences this year.
However, among TV shows, my favorites were **Fallout S1**, **Tokyo Vice S1 and
S2** and **Shōgun S1**. **Silo S2** is also up there, but the season will still
continue in 2025. It might make next year's year in review.

#### Games

There were also some video games, but I haven't finished any of them. I started
playing **Hades**, **Baldur's Gate 3** and **Pacific Drive**, all single-player
games. I also got an invite to **Deadlock**, which I have played a bit and it
feels like a breath of fresh air for me. I might be biased towards Valve,
because I will play anything they put out that isn't _Counter-Strike_.

#### Books

It wasn't until today I realized that I have read/listened to a bunch of books
this year. I managed to read 9 books, where 7 of them was from the Murderbot
diaries, which are some of my all-time favorite books. The books felt like a
cinematic movie like Blade Runner 2049 in space with epic hallway fights between
man and machine. There's even a TV show coming out next year (hopefully), and I
couldn't be more excited!

## Looking ahead

Now that my neck is stiff after looking back for so long, it's time to look
ahead.

### Knowns and unknowns

In software development we often talk about unknown unknowns, and I think that
fits perfectly with everyday as well. And when heading into 2025 I know that
some stuff will happen and there plenty of stuff that I don't know that will
happen.

Some of the stuff I know that will happen in 2025:

- I'm turning 29
- My daughter is turning 2
- Work will require more focus (hopefully a future blogpost)
- My sister's confirmation
- Family trips

There's probably some stuff I'm forgetting, but hey, at least I know what I'm
heading into ;)

### Yearly themes

After this year's success, I will have yearly themes for 2025.

In 2025 my primary yearly theme will be: **Year of analog**:

- Read more physical books
- Download more long-form content onto my reMarkable
- Leave my phone behind
- Write blogposts in my notebook or on my reMarkable before publishing
- (maybe ditch my Apple Watch (again))

My secondary theme will be: **Year of finishing**. During my spare-time I make
side-projects and 99 % of the time I stick in [zer0ver](https://0ver.org/), but
in 2025 I want to make the jump to more `v1.0.0` and be satisfied with my
initial features.

## See you next year!

Thank you for reading my blog this year! It has been fun – and I look forward to
continue writing in 2025.
