Here we are again, another monthly recap of what has happened since last time.
Not a lot of updates, but I have a lot of links to make up for it!

## üçÄ Life

Our daughter has started to walk, baby-steps! Another milestone! There hasn't
been any other stuff going on this past month, we've had some friends and family
visit us from out-of-town. But I've been mostly busy with work and the usual
day-to-day stuff.

## üí™ Health

Ran a shorter race this month, a 10K in Bergen. It was more difficult than I
expected, I thought the track was supposed to be much more flat. But I ended up
finishing the 10K in 0:54:30, wanted to beat 0:50:00, but maybe next year!

Other than the race I have been running frequently, and I'm looking forward to
October's next race, another half-marathon - hopefully I will beat my record
this time!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technology

Like I mentioned last month, I've been learning Go and this month I actually
started writing Go both at work and in a personal project. I remaking my CLI for
[yr.no], which I wrote with Deno last time. You can checkout what I have so far
over on [SourceHut], it's not finished yet, but I work on it when I have time.
Go is starting to grow on me, I like the safety it provides and how easy it is
to pick up. The support for it in [Helix] is also good, although the LSP can be
a bit slow sometimes.

I got a new keyboard this month, I even wrote a blogpost about it: [New
keyboard, who dis?]. I'm starting to get the hang of it, and I'm glad I bought
it - it's fun to write again.

Another thing I did this month was wipe my gaming PC again, and install
[Bazzite]. I haven't actually gotten around to play anything on it yet, but I
just started Deadlock on Win11. Also, Deadlock is a lot of fun, and very
different from what I'm used to playing. Might come a review of the "distro" in
the near future if I get around to actually use it.

## üé¨ Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

Lots of Game of Thrones, and I believe we only have the worst to come üòÇ

### Movies

- **Fly Me to the Moon (2024)** ‚Äì OK. It was fun to learn more about the
  history, but it seems like they changed a lot of actual history.

### TV

- **Game of Thrones S4** ‚Äì Rewatching the show. Having so much fun!
- **Game of Thrones S5** ‚Äì Rewatch. I totally forgot how this season ended,
  fantastic!
- **Game of Thrones S6** ‚Äì Rewatch!

  still don't plan to in the nearest future. I think it's because of what the
  author says in this post. Replace bad distractions with good ones!

  automatic foucs-mode on my iPhone when I start working, and the only person
  that can message me with notifications is my SO. Everyone else has to wait for
