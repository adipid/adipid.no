[Kaizen][kaizen], Japanese for improvement, is a term I first heard about from
[The Changelog podcast][thechangelog]. In their unofficial
[Kaizen-series][kaizen_changelog], they talk about what changes they have made
to their stack, infrastructure etc. TL;DR it's about continuous improvement.

And I'm stealing their concept! Or maybe borrowing, who knows?!

I'm turning the concept into a new blog-series, [#kaizen](/tags/kaizen). It will
be the home of all my blogpost that are about `timharek.no`, and my stack,
homelab and infrastructure in general.

There won't be any frequency to how often there will be a new Kaizen-post, they
will be posted as thing happen. Hopefully I will complete my [TODOs](/todo) now!

Starting things of: I will be doing [CalVer][calver] for `timharek.no` going
forward, making it easier to snapshot changes. It will only be for `YYYY.MM`,
there won't be any patches.

To end with a tease, I recently (last week) got a [Zimaboard][zimaboard] which I
haven't fully tested yet. And I might try to move more of my homelab over to it.
