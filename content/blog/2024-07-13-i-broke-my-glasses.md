Earlier this week I broke my glasses, or more like I accidentally lost on of the
arms to the frame. I was out fishing with family and I had attached my glasses
to my pants. After 4–5 hours out on the ocean wearing just sunglasses I only
noticed that I had lost one of the arms after I got back home.

Since I own a 3D-printer my immediate thought was to check for 3D models online.
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any for my specific Oakley model. However, I did
find something that was similar to my model on
[Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/478882-oakley-sliver), but the
attachment-mechanism was the opposite of what my glasses have. So I had to use
duct-tape to keep them together, but I only managed to use that for a couple of
hours before it became to cumbersome to constantly readjust my glasses because
they became too loose.

Then I came across
[another model](https://www.printables.com/model/580728-tomato-glasses-kids-b-glasses-replacement-armstemp),
but for some children's glasses, that had almost the same attachment-mechanism.
They worked, but now my only problem was that the glasses was loose, but at
least they didn't require any duct-tape.

The next day I booked an appointment to check my eyesight and look for new
glasses. After the check I learned that my eyesight had barely gotten worse, but
I needed new glasses anyway, so I bought a new pair. I had had my current
glasses for only 3 years, but I couldn't use them in their current state for
much longer. They said it would take 2–3 weeks until I got them, so I bought a
paracord-thingy to make my current glasses a bit more bearable to use.

After three days of using my jerryrigged glasses I finally realized I can design
a simple arm myself in [Plasticity]. I took a photo of the arm I had for the
glasses alongside my calipers for scale. After about 2 hours I had 3D-printed
two prototypes where the last one actually fitted. So I cleaned up the model a
bit and printed a new model with 0.10 mm layer height with PETG. And the end
result is almost the same as the one I have from before. They have basically the
same flexibility and look.

Now I have a pair of good backup glasses when the new ones arrive. And if this
happens again I will model the arms myself from the get-go. It's too expensive
to buy a new pair.
