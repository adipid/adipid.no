Yesterday, July 1st, I received an email from a "Raymond":

> Hey Tim,
>
> Enjoyed reading your post on revamping your homelab. It’s great to see your
> continuous improvement journey!
>
> Noticed you’re using Deno Fresh for your blog. Managing updates and
> deployments must be quite the task.
>
> I've built Wisp, a CMS that simplifies content management, perfect for your

>
> Would love to hear your thoughts!
>
> Best, Raymond

At first I thought this was from a reader, because of the first sentence, that
happened to work on a CMS called Wisp. But something was off, since they saw
that I used Deno Fresh for my blog I assumed that they must have dug a bit
deeper before saying a CMS is "perfect for your needs". But if they had made an
effort they could have found out that I use plaintext Markdown and that I enjoy
that workflow because it's set up using CI/CD.

I went to check out Wisp CMS and saw that it was headless CMS, alright. Then I
went straight to their blog, and saw that the latest blogpost, from today July
2nd, was "[How I Use AI Agents to Send 1000 Personalized Email for Outreach]".
And right there in the featured image of the post was almost exactly the email I
had received.

And then I remembered one of the links from [last month], a blogpost by Neven
Mrgan: [How it feels to get an AI email from a friend]

I don't think this is the one and the same, but there are similarities. If
"Raymond" had made an effort to write this email and showed me how their CMS
would solve something for my particular blog, I would most likely checked it out
with an open mind, but they didn't do that.

And their blogpost starts of with:

> Have you ever received an email that felt so personalized, so tailored to your
> interests and experiences, that you couldn't help but be intrigued? What if I
> told you that email wasn't crafted by a human, but by an artificial
> intelligence (AI) agent?

I don't really have words for this, but I dislike this. Another part of the
post:

> I used AI agents to send out nearly 1,000 personalized emails to developers
> with public blogs on GitHub.

Does this mean that I should private my GitHub-mirror to my personal blog,
because this can become a common thing? I have removed my email from my
GitHub-profile now, but they can probably get it from my Git-log anyway...

Thanks Raymond, I hate spam.
