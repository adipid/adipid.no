Time moves fast when you're having fun!

Just a single blogpost this month: [I built a weather CLI]

## üçÄ Life

It's been an eventful month! We went to my third wedding this year (my SO's
fourth), we had family over for autumn-break, and our daughter has started to
walk everywhere. Our daughter has also started to say more words and is
communicating more and more with us every day, it's so fulfilling and rewarding
to see her progression, even just by the day-to-day.

## üí™ Health

I ran a new half-marathon, but man did I mess up! I finished in 2:20:07. Up
until the race I had been sick, I thought I was OK for the race but after
half-way I realized that I wasn't. Became more sick after the race, I don't
think my immune-system liked that. October was a bad month when it comes to
running...

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

Go, go, and go! I'm still learning Go, it helps a lot that I have been using it
at work every day. But when I sign-off for the day I can't seem to shake the
need for programming. Like I mentioned last month, I remade my CLI for yr.no. It
has more features and feels so much faster (probably because I implemented
caching).

The trash collection-company in Bergen doesn't provide a digital calendar for
when they collect our trash, they provide that information on their website and
in their app. And I don't like on-off apps. So I sat down one day and created a
scraper that provides a calendar-subscription feed with my collection days. I
have used it every week since. And of course I made it in Go üòé.
[Source code](https://git.sr.ht/~timharek/bir) for those interested.

And lastly I have been remaking another project of mine in Go, my website!
However, I'm doing this to teach myself more Go, and see how the web-stuff work.
It's a big project, my current website has a lot of features handmade by me and
some features from Fresh. With Go I have to mostly make everything from scratch.
To my surprise, a lot of stuff is built-in and is fairly simple to do. It's a
lot of fun. And who knows, maybe I will switch? It's not my first time...

## üé¨ Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **The Wild Robot** ‚Äì It was not what I expected, at all. I thought it would be
  a more Wall-E movie. It was an entertaining watch and an incredible looking
  animation, I love the style where they mix 3D animation with 2D drawings.
- **The Apprentice** ‚Äì Trump Origin story. This was really something. I highly
  recommend watching this.
- **The Batman** ‚Äì Rewatch. The atmosphere in this movie is excellent, the
  world-building, I love it!

## TV

Started watching **The Penguin S1**, but we're waiting until the season is
finished before we finish this one. My SO also managed to get me to watch
_drum-roll_, **Squid Game S1**, three years after everyone else watched it. And
I finally realized that **Vox Machina S3** is out, so I'm also watching that.

### Games

I picked up **Baldur's Gate 3** again this week. It's been a lot of fun! Also
played some matched of **Deadlock**, looking forward to what Valve ends up with
this game.

## üåê Links

Not a lot of links this month, but here are some nonetheless.

- [ZeroVer] ‚Äì This is hilarious.
- [Ingredients ‚Äì Analyze Websites] ‚Äì Perfect tool for analyzing website, it's
  fast, free and open source!
- [How I use git] ‚Äì I like simple!
- [Expose yourself to as much as possible] ‚Äì These are some great tips and
  examples on how to improve yourself.
- [The Problem With Building Good Habits] ‚Äì I think this author looks at
  habit-building backwards, like a chore. Whenever I want to make a habit out of
  something, I want to make it as simple as possible to start. Like the author's
  example for flossing, I bought toothbrush-kinda flosser and have it next to my
  toothbrush. Resulting in me flossing every single day, not because I want to,
  but because I'm used to it and it easy to do.
- [Nobody wants to use any software] ‚Äì "It‚Äôs just fucking computers"
- [I don't have LinkedIn] ‚Äì I needed this years ago.
