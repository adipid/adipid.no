## üçÄ Life

I visited to my hometown for a family confirmation, and I traveled alone because
my <abbr title="significant other">SO</abbr> was going to a wedding elsewhere.
It was my first time driving alone for 3 hours with our daughter, and it was my
SO's first time being away from our daughter for more than a workday. It was
fine, we all survived!

We celebrated our daughter's first National Day on the 17th of May with family
and a trip to a school. I wonder how next year is going to be when she's in
kindergarten.

And to talk about something super interesting: The weather this past month has
been superb! We have gone on long walks every day (almost). Somedays was so warm
that we couldn't be outside for too long because of the heat ‚òÄÔ∏è

## üí™ Health

No race this month, and I have still managed to run an average of 15 km per week
this month. It's been a blast (and warm)!

I have also got a lot of use of the baby-carrier we bought last month, it's
really fun to hear our daughter "talking" and laughing when we see animals,
cars, plants etc. Great purchase!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

Other than doing some [migrations of my Deno
modules][All my Deno modules are now available on JSR], I have been working slow
and steady on my logging tool. It's getting there, hopefully it will be ready
this summer. I'm not sure how "general" I should make it, if it's interesting
for anyone other than me. But we'll see, it might be easier to see that once I
write a standalone blogpost about it.

Like I mentioned in the intro, there is a new edition of [Kaizen](/tags/kaizen)
out: [Kaizen #2]

<!-- TODO: What have you programming as of late? -->

## üé¨ Entertainment

This month we mananged to watch a bunch of movies, shows and I even managed to
play some video games.

### Games

This month, after my co-worker still went on and on about how good Hades was, I
caved and got it on Steam. And I have been enjoying it very much on the Steam
Deck. Haven't beaten the last boss, yet, but it's fun! And I get nostaglic about
remembering all the Gods from Greek Mythology from my memory of the animated
Hercules movie.

I also posted my [Playdate review] where I go in-depth on the whole thing.

### Movies

- **Late Night with the Devil (2023)** ‚Äì Really cool, and different horror
  movie. It was more like a thriller to me, but enjoyed it!
- **Dream Scenario (2023)** ‚Äì This was so weird and thought-provoking that it
  was really funny and scary at the same time. Bonus, Norwegian director and
  writer
- **Secrets of the Neanderthals (2024)** ‚Äì Boring Netflix documentary.
- **Turbo Kid (2015)** ‚Äì Gave it a watch just because of the soundtrack and I do
  not regret it, recommended!
- **Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024)** ‚Äì I didn't miss Andy Serkis that
  much, and it was fun to see where all the apes were 300 years after the last
  movie.
- **The Fall Guy (2024)** ‚Äì I had high hopes for this one after Bullet Train, it
  was bland. The fight-scenes were cool, but there weren't enough of it to make
  it a good movie.
- **The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (2024)** ‚Äì A cool war-movie about
  _real_ events, recommended!

### TV shows

- **Baby Reindeer S1** ‚Äì Everyone was talking about it, and we also started to
  talk about it. Eerie and amazing at the same time.
- **X-Men '97 S1** ‚Äì Wow. They made a heartfelt cartoon, I mean, revived cartoon
  about mutants and a dab of time-travel. It was awesome!
- **Hvite gutter S7** ‚Äì Norwegian show about some rich/spolied white dudes that
  only parties, it has its moments.
