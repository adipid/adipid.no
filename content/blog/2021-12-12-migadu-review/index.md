[Migadu](https://migadu.com) is an e-mail service provider that provide its
service for a flat price. It's built upon open source technologies and market
themselves as a service that has no interest in looking at your e-mail. No
advertising, no tracking - no bullshit.

I've been using Migadu exclusively for about 8 months as of writing and it's
been a very pleasant experience. I use it for all my personal e-mail
communications for all my domains and I even had [friByte](https://fribyte.no)
(student organization I'm involved in) switch from self-hosting their e-email to
start using Migadu exclusively.

## Pros

There are a lot of positive things to say about Migadu so I will try my best to
list them as good as I can.

### Privacy-first

As mentioned in the introduction they are using open source technologies and are
providing a privacy-first experience, you own your own emails. The service is
built upon standard protocols like IMAP, POP and SMTP which means you can take
out your e-mail whenever you feel like. It makes it very easy to switch
providers if that's needed.

### Superb support

In the 8 months I've been using Migadu I contacted them four times, and they
fully answered and/or fulfilled my request each time. I even asked them to split
one domain from one of my aliases in my primary mailbox, and they managed to do
so within a few hours.

They are quick to reply and very nice people!

### Fantastic setup-process

Setting up domains is very straight forward, there are excellent instructions
that they provide along the way to help even non-techy people. You can even use
their nameservers to make it even more convenient (but I haven't tried it).

It's intuitive to setup multiple domains, aliases, mailboxes etc. They provide
you with a good explanations for their recommended DNS configuration and gives
you the option to test it when you've finished setting it up. You can run
DNS-diagnostics to see if you messed up somewhere in the process.

### Unlimited mailboxes

This was one of the big reasons why I switched from ProtonMail
([read about it here](/blog/migrate-pm-migadu)). I don't really use that many
mailboxes, but I use ~5, it varies. And the setup for this is also very straight
forward. I have my primary mailbox setup with 1 primary domain and 3 alias
domains and have catch-all setup for all of the domains. This makes it very
convenient when I sign-up for new services or need to provide someone or
something with an e-mail address. I can make up something random on the spot
instead of having to give away my personal e-mail each time.

## Cons

I actually don't have anything bad to say about Migadu.

## Conclusion

Do I recommend Migadu? Oh yes I do! It's been a very pleasent 8 months and I'm
really looking forward to continue using them and recommending them!

Also really looking forward to their new CalDav-thingy that they've told me has
an ETA in January. Hopefully that can help me get away from using iCloud for my
personal calendar - who knows!
