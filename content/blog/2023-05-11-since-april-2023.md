Again I missed writing my recently-post for April. Well, it's no big deal.
Between my [previous post](/blog/march-recently) and today a few things has
happend.

We bought a house two weeks ago, and we sold our apartment last week! We're
super excited to move into the new house and say goodbye to our apartment. It's
going to be so nice starting this next chapter in our lives!

I've been busy doing prepartions for both the sale and purchase these last
couple of months, but I've managed to sneak in some time writing some code after
hours. My latest project [Hima][hima] is coming along nicely, I'm looking
forward to utilizing it properly when we move into the new place.

Not a lot more has happend since last time. I have a few new blog posts in my
backlog that I have to finish, soon (TM).
