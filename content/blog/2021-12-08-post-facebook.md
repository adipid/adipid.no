> Do you regret leaving Facebook?

No, not really.

It's been a month since [I left Facebook](/blog/goodbye-facebook), for good, and I feel relieved. For 
the last couple of years I hadn't spent much time on Facebook, mostly because
I didn't enjoy it nor did I agree in the way they treat their users data and
privacy. So for the last month by being officially done with Facebook
it feels like a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders.

My transition hasn't been very noticeable in terms of my everyday. I've slowly
asked my friends and family to join me on Signal over the last couple of years,
so I really haven't noticed that I've missed out on anything. Whenever there has
been any events happening my friends have been kind enough to let me know via
other means than social media, so I've still managed to be social ðŸ˜Ž

## What now?

I will continue to use my Mastodon account, [tim@snabelen.no](https://snabelen.no/@tim),
for the foreseeable future. And I will continue to advocate for privacy and ask 
friends and family to use services like Signal, Matrix etc. for secure
communications.

I'm exicted for the future, to see if my personal relationships become stronger
and if I reach out to friends and family anymore than before! Also to see if
me being off mainstream social media will inspire anyone to start looking at 
other alternatives, who knows? ðŸ¤·
