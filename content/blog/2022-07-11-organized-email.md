First of all, this is how I do things and it works wonders for me, it may or may
not work for you. Let's get to it!

I've used e-mail since mid 00s, not that I sent a lot of e-mail back then, but I
had an e-mail account that I needed in order to create other accounts. I had one
Gmail account and one Hotmail account, I only kept my Hotmail account around
because of MSN[^1]. I only really needed my e-mail accounts for other online
accounts and the occasional promo code, and I really never deleted those.

Fast-forward a few years my cousin shows me around on his computer and I notices
how clean his inbox is, and he shows me this neat thing called labels/folder in
Gmail. He told me that he archives e-mails he's done with and try to keep the
inbox as empty as possible.

And fast-forward to today and here I am, still practising what he showed me
16-17 years ago. Here's how to get started.

## Inbox zero (sort of)

What it is is very much in the name, but for the uninitiated, it means keeping
your inbox empty or at least as close to empty as possible.

My way is very similar, but I don't necessarily need to keep it totally empty.

Whenever I receive an email I either;

1.  Delete the e-mail,
2.  Put it in a folder,
3.  Keep it in my inbox for later

And I always, always mark my e-mails as read as soon as I can. The inbox with
stuff in it is the "reminder".

## When to delete

You might ask:

> When do I delete e-mail?

My answer is whenever you can, some examples of what you don't need in your
inbox and/or e-mail is;

- Password resets
- Welcome/sign up/thank you e-mails
- Login alerts (ofc. keep them if they are suspicious)
- Newsletters that you've read

Do you keep deleting newsletters, promotions etc.? Why don't you just
unsubscribe from them, then you don't need to use valuable time on them.

## Using folders/labels

With today's e-mail services you get great search, and it's fast. But sometimes
you can't remember what to search for, but you vaguely remember its "category".
This is where folders/labels come in.

Right of the bat, the difference between labels and folders are that labels are
a way of marking an e-mail with a label and also having the ability to archive
the e-mail within said label. A folder is simply just a folder. I use folders.

How you manage your folders is very personal, but whenever someone asks me what
I recommend starting of I usually say:

- Work-related stuff
  - Create sub-folders if you have multiple employments
- Finance, banking etc.
  - Subfolders with order confirmations, receipts and invoices
- Family

Then, whenever I get for example an invoice, I keep it in my inbox until I've
paid it and then archive it to my _invoices_ folder. But what if I get an e-mail
for something I don't have a folder for? Then I simply archive it within a
folder (that I think all services have) called _archive_. There can be times
when it's actually useful to create a new temporary folder, but then you need to
remember to tidy it up later. I usually do this for trips where there are a lot
of e-mails related to that specific trip.

To sum up _using folders_, when you get an e-mail react to it as soon as
possible and try to archive it to a folder.

## How to start

⚠️ Do not try to clean up your e-mail in one go, it will be painful and it takes
time.

Try to keep a mindset about doing it over time. Create the new folders and try
to establish those routines mentioned earlier.

And if you want to get a head-start and get tidying you can start by searching
for:

- Password resets
- Login alerts
- Unsubscribe
- Welcome / sign up / thank you

And then delete them as you see fit!

This is how I recommend getting started. If you have any questions or
suggestions feel free to send me an e-mail :)
