Since I remove social media from my life friends and family has asked me
how I keep up with birthdays (they ask about other stuff too, don't worry). My
answer is simple, I store the birthdays for my close friends and family in their
contact ([vCard]) on my phone. On iOS this works excellent with the built-in
calendar.

That's pretty much it.

I recorded my phone to quickly demonstrate the feature:

It seems like the feature is available on Android as well, but I haven't tested
it: <https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/13748346?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid>

If you have tested it, please let me know and I'll update the post.

And now you're one step closer to not forgetting your friend's and family's
birthdays.
