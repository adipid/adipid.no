This Thursday was the first day of my paternal leave from work. I will be
staying at home taking care of our 6 month-old baby full-time for the 158 days.
It feels strange and exciting at the same time. I'm looking forward to spending
the next 5 months with our daughter, it's going to be an amazing time!

For those who are curious, in Norway both parents are able to take parental
leave. In total you can have _49 weeks_ with 100% pay or _59 weeks_ with 80%
pay, it's up to the parents.

We divided it so I get 20 weeks, plus I'll be taking some vacation days so I
don't start work in the middle of the Norwegian summer-holidays. I end up with
approximately 22 weeks in total.

I'm grateful for our parental leave system. That both parents are able to spend
so much time with their newborn during such an important time, cruical even. And
you get to experience so many _firsts_. And you could argue that I will probably
have the most fun _firsts_ ðŸ˜Ž

Not going to work for the 158 days will be strange. The place I started to work
last August had just started up within another accounting company. We are still
figuring things out, we have ongoing and upcoming projects in the works. Leaving
that felt like rushing out the door, not sure how else I can describe it. I'm
curious to see if I manage to not sneak-peak into my work Slack and email the
next months. I'm fortunate that my carrer is also my hobby, so I'll (hopefully)
be able to work on some personal projects from time to time.

It's going to be some fun and exciting days, weeks and months coming! There's
going to be a bunch of days where we'll basically do the same every day, but
that's OK. I think it'll be important to establish a routine early on. A goal of
mine is to try to explore the most we can in our neighbourhood, since we only
moved here last July.

Not sure if I'll continue writing about my paternal leave other than in my
[recently](/tags/recently)-posts going forward. It feels too personal, but I
felt like this post is just personal enough. Who knows, maybe I'll keep more
updates coming. And maybe I have more time (doubt it) to write other posts.

What do you think about paternal leave for 22 weeks? How does it work in your
country?
