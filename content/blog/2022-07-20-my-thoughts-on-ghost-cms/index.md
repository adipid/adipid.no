My first encounter with Ghost CMS was back in 2014 when their [Kickstarter
launched][kickstarter] when I was still a newbie. I remember migrating my
October CMS website to Ghost CMS and never really using it.

Fast-forward to today, we are hired to create a website using Ghost CMS
(henceforth referred to as Ghost), the first time anyone at work had worked with
it. We went in with the assumption that it would be familiar to what we're used
to with Craft CMS.

To give some backstory for the reason behind choosing Ghost for our client, they
are a small company that mainly do in-person stuff, but they also have
live-streams twice a month where they introduce their subscribers to a new wine
and sometimes a new food recipe, which they like to post about online, only for
their subscribers. To participate in these live-streams you need to be a
subscriber. Ghost is built for handling memberships and subscriptions. The
people behind Ghost also provides a service where they can host your site for a
fee, Ghost Pro, which is usually less expensive than having to self-host like
you need to for Craft CMS, and you need to pay for both the server and a
CMS-license, and maybe even some plugins. With Ghost hosted with Ghost Pro much
of the expenses were taken away.

## What I like about Ghost

I like the clean and simple admin UI Ghost has, it's simple and streamlined.
Nothing fancy, each button and link takes were you want to go. And I really like
that I don't have to think about how it handles members, membership tiers,
subscriptions and payments! Their [theme-starter][theme_starter] is a great
starting point for creating a new theme.

## My frustrations

### Documentation

After developing for 2-3 weeks Ghost announces Ghost CMS 5, which looks cool but
we don't see the need to try to upgrade as of now, so we continue working with
our current Ghost CMS 4 version. But then we came across a problem, I was trying
to render the membership tiers but nothing rendered... although I looked at
their documentation. But then I check their code-example in our repository (from
their theme-starter) and it was different. I head over to GitHub and learned
that Ghost 5.0 had changed the API, and I thought I was looking at the wrong
version of the documentation. And then we realized that you cannot see the
documentation for previous versions of Ghost CMS, you can only see the current
version number in the docs. Therefore we upgraded our Ghost CMS version from 4.x
to 5.0, we had some deprecations, but their `gscan`-tool helped us fixing it.

### Handlebars.js

[Handlebars.js][handlebars] is a templating language that is made to minimal. It
comes with a few built-in filters, and you can create your own filters. However,
in Ghost you cannot create your own filters unless you fork Ghost yourself and
self-host. And Ghost provide some [helpers][ghost_helpers].

#### Conditionals

I had barely touched Handlebars when we started the project and was not too
familiar with the syntax and I assumed it was going to be straight forward. I
quickly came to a roadblock when I couldn't check if a _variable_ was equal to a
_string_.

This is what I initially tried:

```hbs
{{#if myVariable == "my-string"}} Do something {{/if}}
```

This doesn't work, it's invalid. You have to use Ghost's own helper
[`has`][helper_has]. And the syntax looks like this:

```hbs
{{#has myVariable="my-string"}} Do something {{/has}}
```

One would think that something like this would be built-in to Handlebars... ðŸ˜…
To emphasize my point even further, look at Ghost's
[helpers][ghost_helpers]-page, they four conditionals filters (`if`, `has`,
`unless` & `match`) for something that is built-in in most other templating
languages.

#### Missing helper from the documentation

We wanted the end-user to be able to see which page they were currently on in
the main navigation. Alright, let's check their [helpers][ghost_helpers]. No
mention of checking current page. Alright, I tried to search for `current` in
their search, nothing stands out immediately, but there's a result for
[`link_class`][helper_link_class], which isn't listed on the
[helpers][ghost_helpers]-page. This page contains almost what we're looking for,
but we don't want to manually specify which page-url we're checking.

```hbs
<li class="nav {{link_class for="/about/"}}">About</li>
```

We want to check for a whole list of pages, not one and one page. We discovered
that what we're looking for is under the
[`navigation`-helper][helper_navigation]. The check we are looking for is only
mentioned in one code example with no description of the "check" and it's also
mentioned in the list of attributes.

```hbs
<li class="nav {{#if current}}current-class{{/if}}">About</li>
```

### Custom components and editor cards

I made an assumption that we could create our own components, since it's
possible to create stuff in the `partials`-folder. But it's not possible to
create custom components. You're only able to use the ones that are built-in,
and there isn't a lot to choose from. You can't for example have a picture with
text on the left or right side of the picture.

And it's also not possible to customize the HTML-structure of the cards from the
editor, you are only able to [deactive its CSS][ghost_cards_css] and update what
each CSS-class should look like, and not alter the CSS-classname.

### More missing documentation (for admins/editors)

While working on the theme our client started to migrate their subscribers from
their previous provider. They wanted to give them two months for free when they
signed up again, they did that by creating a promotion from within the CMS. But
when they tried to open the promotion-link they were sent directly to Stripe
instead of the pop-up preview they were shown in the UI.

    alt="Screenshot of pop-up preview">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

We contacted Ghost, they replied that you need to active the
[Portal-button][portal_button] in order for the pop-up to work. And this is not
mentioned in the documentation either.

## Takeaways, what I learned

These are my thoughts about Ghost, and it's not like I'm irritated or angry
about using Ghost for our client. It worked out great given my (minor)
frustrations. And I've learned a lot about how a limited CMS can be utilized
properly instead of trying to [shoehorning][shoehorning] every inch of it.
Furthermore, I've summarized what I've learned:

- Ghost is mainly for blog-like content.
  - It has limited customizability when it comes to how the content is rendered
    in the frontend.
  - It can be a good thing, it makes it easier for editor when they don't have
    too many options.
- I should do more tests and try out the technology before I dive deep.
  - With this project I only read their documentation and looked at their
    examples instead of trying to create simple "Hello world"'s myself.
- Ghost's CLI is pretty good!
  - It's straight forward, you can install Ghost in multiple folders with
    different versions.
- `gscan` is a cool utility.
  - More CMS'es should have this. Runs through your code and checks for
    deprecations and warnings, it's great!
  - It helped us a ton when we were "forced" to upgrade to Ghost CMS 5.
- Handlebars seems outdated
  - Not meant in a bad-way, I'm sure it's great when you used it in a way where
    you can easily extend it and built upon it.
- It helps to write down stuff like this.
  - It's something I can look back on, that can be of help for future reference
    not only for me but for others as well.
