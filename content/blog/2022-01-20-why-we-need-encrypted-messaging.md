Picture this: You are planning going on holiday with your significant other (SO),
and you want to surprise them. You need some help from some of your friends, so
you send them a message via Messenger. You tell them your plans, when, where
and what you have planned for for SO. And your friends also talk to other friends
about it, but your SO still doesn't know anything - which is because you and
your friends haven't told them.

Suddenly you get all of these ads whenever you browse the Internet, which are
directly related to what you and your friends talked about.
