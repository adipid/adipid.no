The end of the year is upon us and here I am, ready to recap what happened since
November.

Be sure to checkout my [2024 Year in review](/blog/2024-year-in-review).

## 🍀 Life

Holidays, Christmas, New Year's etc., December is always filled with stuff.

We went to visit my family for Christmas this year, our daughter's second
Christmas. It was a lot of fun, excellent food, and company! Highlight of the
evening has to be seeing our daughter so happy and us getting a full-size grill.

We're currently in the mountains for New Year's, so we get to see snow and
fireworks at the same time ❄️🎆. We're staying at cabin with another couple that
has a daughter the same age as our daughter, it's going to be a no-stress and
chill day and evening.

## 💪 Health

I think I can count on one hand how many days I haven't been sick. I have run
exactly four times this month, and the runs has been bad. As of writing this I'm
also sick, not as bad as earlier, but hoping 2025 will bring less sickness.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

Started working on a [Migadu CLI and Go package], I want to stop using catch-all
for my emails that aren't my main email-address. Hopefully I actually start
using this thing when I'm finished.

I also ported my Deno/TypeScript package for OpenLibrary to [Go]. I'm going to
use it for my personal CLI for logging stuff.

## 🎬 Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery (2024)** – Learned lots of the origin of
  Bitcoin, and about the mystery surrounding its creator.
- **Oldboy (2003)** – I had high expectations for this. I guessed the twist at
  the beginning when they introduced a character... The movie was a letdown
  because of that. I think I've seen to many movies over the years.
- **Louis & Luca and the Snow Machine (2013)** – Flåklypa/Pinchcliffe! The
  English title doesn't give the Norwegian title justice. It's a proper
  Christmas movie.

### TV

- **The Penguin S1** – Great show! Intense finale, was not expecting that!
- **The Bear S3** – This season took us a while. We never go hooked like the two
  previous seasons. The story felt like it was all over the place.
- **Secret Level S1** – Lots of great epiosdes, some better than others. I
  enjoyed episode 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11 the most.
