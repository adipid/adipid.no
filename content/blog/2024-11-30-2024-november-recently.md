Work, sickness, a hospital visit, birthday. November has been eventful!

## üçÄ Life

Our daughter is growing fast and is running around all the time! We have gotten
into a good routine with day-to-day now, with work, kindergarten, family-time 
etc.

It hasn't been hectic at work, but I had a deadline before a demo of an 
integration between two systems that was this week. It was stressful before and
during the demo. I believe we managed to give a good demo and that the stressful
time before the demo was worth it!

## üí™ Health

This has to be my worst health month this year, and probably to date. I managed
to get sick twice/thrice, first with the flu, then followed two weeks later with
a sore throat with an inflammation and to top it of I got sudden pain in my 
private area üòÖ. Been to the doctor thrice, once at the hospital and once at
X-Ray Clinic for ultrasound check.

Therefore I only managed to sneak in a few runs this month, and I'm still 
dealing with pain. The doctors haven't been able to figure anything out based
on my symptoms. Hopefully it goes over by itself.


## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

Still learning Go! I migrated an integration we made a couple of years ago from
Deno with Oak to Go using the standard library net/http. Since I knew the
outcome, I wrote tests for the whole integration, and then we let both
integrations run at the same time for two weeks to see if the outcome was
different, and it wasn't.

A while ago I mentioned something about a personal CLI for my logs, which initially
started out in Deno called `sekk`, but I have since restarted the project and 
called it `art`. I'm making great progress there, [Charm.sh](https://charm.sh)'s
packages for Go is so good for making CLI-apps, and making them interactive.

And since I'm not able to work on a single project at the time, I have also made
a CLI for accessing Migadu's API: <https://sr.ht/~timharek/migadu>

I think it needs to be more interactive to become a v1.0.0. If you want to help
out, patches are welcome!

## üé¨ Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Documentary (2024)** ‚Äì Great doc about HL2 history and everything that went down at Valve at the time with lawsuits and Steam.
- **The Remarkable Life of Ibelin (2024)** ‚Äì Touching story about a person who found his sanctuary in playing video games, making a difference in his own way.

### TV

- **The Legend of Vox Machina S3** ‚Äì It felt like a different show this season, I did enjoy it however, but the pacing felt off. Maybe they can catch-up for next season!
- **Squid Game S1** ‚Äì After years of convincing, my SO managed to get me to watch this show. It was pretty good, not the story I expected at all. The ending felt preditcable, but it was fun to watch!
- **Avlogga S1** ‚Äì Norwegian show about disconnecting and not using a smartphone in a year. Cool project, leanred lots!
