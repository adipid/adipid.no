This month was been a big one! I did a complete rewrite of my website of my
website using Deno and Fresh. I also started in a new job, at Value Tech. And to
top it all, I became a dad! So yeah, this month has been quite something.

## üí™ Health

I managed to keep up running and going to the gym until our newborn came. I had
to skip a half-marathon this month because it was just a few days after. So it's
been two weeks now, and I will eventually return to it, but there are other
things that are my priority now.

## üë®‚ÄçüíªDevelopment

This month I finally did it, what every blogger and developer dreads and loves:
I rewrote my website using a different technology! This is the second time ever
since I started this particular blog. I started with Jekyll, then ported that
website to Zola and did a complete rewrite using Deno and Fresh this month. Or,
I started work on the project a while back with no intention of actually
switching, but I saw how much fun it was to do everything from scratch that I
just redid the whole thing. And I also had some free-time inbetween when the
newborn and my SO was asleep.

## üìö Reading

I've been reading a bunch of blogposts lately, and I think I should start to
summaries them here (eventually), and I also managed to read a new comicbook and
continue reading "How the world really works", by Vaclav Smil.

- Wolverine: Black, white & blood - An OK read. I thought the comicbook was
  going to be chronological, but it was a bunch of different ones.

## üé¨ Entertainment

### TV

The new Star Wars show Ashoka started last week. I think it has been great for
the first three episodes. I also started to watch Platonic, it's fine, not great
nor bad.

### Movies

- Kopps - A great old Swedish slapstick cop-movie!
- Tetris - This one was really great! I thought the trailer look cool, but I
  didn't expect the movie to be so entertaining.
