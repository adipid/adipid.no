Kurzgesagt recently released a video, [The Internet is Worse Than Ever â€“ Now
What?][video], and it made me reflect on social media as a whole.

I know for myself that I have blamed social media for the polarization and
extremism we see in society today, but I thought it was because people were
enganging with each other in echo chambers. But after watching the video, and
checking their [sources][sources], I see that way not actually be the case.

There are conflicting studies for the argument of echo chambers and filter
bubbles, but a common trait is that a lot of studies agree that the algorithms
on social media aims to keep people online and engaged for the longest amount of
time. They keep you engaged by showing enganging content. Angry and extreme
opinions that keeps people enganged.

And because we sort people into "groups" based on worldviews and find
disagreement threatening, social media continues to feed us shit. It keeps us
enganged. It's an endless circle.

And I keep thinking back to before I deleted my social media accounts. I
remember I stopped engaging with content, because it made me feel like shit and
that someone else were either always better or had a higher apprecited opinion.
When I decieded not to engange with stuff anymore, just to browse, I managed to
escape the need to keep up with everything and I was able to put it away after I
was done, to a degree. I still ended up deleting my accounts, because of privacy
and taking back control of my time.

I think we need to start looking at the Internet more like we did before social
media. We should mirror real life. Keeping stuff in smaller silos. Smaller,
separated online communities that allow people to curate their experiences
instead of a single large town square.

The communties doesn't have to be place where people collectively post and
engage, it can be as simple as a blog. You can create engangement by having
people share their opinion via email, or a mailing list. Like [Erik][erik]
wrotes in his [The future of social media][erik_post]:

To conclude, I hope that we can go back to smaller communities with more focused
content and give up the need to be online 24/7. Let us log off more often and go
outside :)

What do you think? Should we try to embrace smaller communties or find better
solutions to existing social media?
