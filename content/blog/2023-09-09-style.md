Stephen Ango recently wrote about style, and how it can be a [consistent
constraint][ango_post] and that inspired me to write this post.

Ever since I read Charles Duhigg's [The Power of Habit][habit_book] in 2015,
I've been fasinated by habits and consistency. When I read the book I became
much more aware of my own habits and routines.

After telling yourself to do a certain behaviour over time, making a routine,
like wearing a certain kind of clothes, washing up after eating etc., it will
eventually become a habit.

Habits and routines can be a form for style. It can help when you need to stay
consistent. You don't need to think of them as constraints, but rather a way to
offload the need to consider or think about something, letting you use that
energy on something more important. An example could be: What am I going to wear
tomorrow? If you have established a style, it will become automatic and you
don't need to spend time nor energy when making the decision.

Some examples from my own habits and routines:

- I wear clothes without logos.
- I use `YYYY-MM-DD` ([ISO 8601][iso]) dates everywhere.
- I bring my notebook everywhere.
- I reverse park anywhere I can.
- I use [conventional commits][con_commit] when using Git.

Like Stephen, I want to say you do you. Don't let anyone else tell you what is
better, forming habits and routines doesn't happen overnight. Experiment and let
yourself be inspired by others and find your own.
