You may have thought that I wasn't going to do a post for December after my
[2023 Year in review]()-post, but here I am!

December has mostly been about preparation for the holidays and the holidays. We
have had visitors from afar, and we have been spending lots of time with family
ü§ó

Posts in December:

- [The future of social media](/blog/the-future-of-social-media)
- [Passwords](/blog/passwords) (repost from my sunset digital garden)
- [How to generate QR-codes](/blog/qr-codes) (repost from my sunset digital
  garden)

## üí™ Health

This has to be the laziest month all year. My only excuse was the weather, that
I couldn't run because of the icy and slippery roads. But I can still run, I
don't have to keep the same pace. Like everyone else, I'm going to turn up the
frequency for January 2024! I have a half-marathon coming up January 20th 2024,
so I need to get running again ASAP!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Website

I sunset my digital garden, previously `/garden`. I came to the conclusion that
I don't want to keep "notes" up-to-date in more than one place. And I want my
blog to serve the purpose of what I was using my "digital garden" for.

Also made it possible to request JSON from my web pages and blogposts, ie.:

```bash
curl --header "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8000/privacy
```

And now I can commit my draft-posts without them appearing on my production
website, so for those curious you can browse my source code to see if I have any
posts cooking.

And last, but not least, I revamped my [Feedroll](/logs/feedroll) (blogroll)
with all the feeds I follow using RSS. I found out that I can access the
OPML-file from NetNewsWire directly on my machine. So my update-workflow will be
to simply use `cp <path-to-opml> ./static/api/feeds.opml`.

## üé¨ Entertainment

### TV

I stopped watching **Monarch: Legacy of monsters S1** after episode 4 because
the acting of the main characters became so bad and rushed. And also stopped
watching **Platonic S1** because it became really boring after three episodes.

### Movie

- **Klaus (2019)** ‚Äì A really fun Christmas-movie! I never knew I needed a Santa
  Claus origin story.
- **Leo (2023)** ‚Äì Such a delight of a animated movie. Good humor and voice
  acting!
- **Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget (2023)** ‚Äì Very good! I still remember the
  original like it was yesterday!
- **Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)** ‚Äì Awesome animated
  movie! The pacing and story was really good. And the animation was impressive,
  I was expecting more of the same style as the Spider-Verse movies, but this
  felt much more comicbook-like.

And I just realized that I've only watched animated movies this month üòÖ And
they were all good!
