It's the end of the month again, and that wraps the first month of 2025!

## üçÄ Life

I started off the year with a new job title, I'm now officially the Tech lead at
Value Technology. And work has been keeping me busy, I have been pretty tired
after work a few days this past month.

Our daughter is growing strong! She always wants be outside, whatever weather,
and that's how it should be! She's really enjoying kindergarten and we couldn't
be more happy. As I'm writing this the kindergarten is having a "planning-day",
so my daughter and I have been at home all day, or we have been hanging out the
whole weekday having a blast. She has taken a real liking towards animals,
especially our dog and cat, she yells their names most of the time and follows
them around the house.

And I started buying physical media again, I have bought 11 Blu-rays this month,
and I will probably buy more in the coming months and years. It's really nice
being able to rip them, organize and play them with Jellyfin. I will probably
write a blogpost about that in the near future!

## üí™ Health

The weather has been all of over the place, I managed to sneak in a run in the
first week, but then it became cold and icy. In total of January I managed to
run about 28 km in total. Hopefully February will be warmer!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

It's been quiet on the development end of things. I have done some minor work on
my existing open source projects, and made a tiny bit of progress on my personal
CLI tool. And I finally started to write some code on my Hima rewrite in Go. It
looks like it will take awhile.

## üé¨ Entertainment

From my [logs](/logs).

### Movies

- **Wolfs (2024)** ‚Äì The first/last movie we watched for New Year's Eve. Fun to
  see Clooney and Pitt work together again, but not much more than that.
- **Gladiator (2000)** ‚Äì Can't remember the last time I watched this, but it
  still holds up!
- **There Will Be Blood (2007)** ‚Äì Greed! I kept waiting for someone to fuck
  over the main characters.
- **A Ghost Story (2017)** ‚Äì It was a weirdly slow-pace movie that made sense.
  Death is a weird topic. And ghosts.

### TV

After **Silo S2**'s finale, we started watching **Severance S2**. And I also
just started watching **Sugar S1**, a really cool show with perfect pacing so
far.

- **What If...? S3** ‚Äì Disappointed, felt like there was no stakes in this
  season at all. And it's a huge waste that this was the last season.
- **Squid Game S2** ‚Äì Great start, was captivated initially, but the ending was
  not so great. The last season had much more open ending whereas this season
  you know there will be season 3.
- **Creature Commandos S1** ‚Äì Awesome characters, haven't heard of any of them
  before except Weasel.
- **Mr. & Mrs. Smith S1** ‚Äì Fun show, lots of laughs and the acting was really
  good. It wasn't too serious, and the spy genre didn't disappoint.
- **Silo S2** ‚Äì The tension! Absolutely loved this season!
