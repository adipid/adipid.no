It's been a quiet month for me. After our newborn came to the world my priorties
have shifted, in a good way. But I still find time for writing and
side-projects.

I managed to write two posts in November:

- [Don't DM me](/blog/dont-dm-me)
- [Removing analytics](/blog/removing-analytics)

## üí™ Health

I'm keeping up the running, at least somewhat. This last week I've been more
busy with work. I have a new race tomorrow, another half-marathon, but I'm not
sure if I'm up for it.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Website

- Updated my [CV](/cv) and [work/projects](/projects).
- [Removed analytics](/blog/removing/analytics) from the blog.
- Added [zod](https://zod.dev) to the parts of my website that relies on JSON.
- Converted my CV-file to a TOML schema. Makes it more readable, IMHO.

## üé¨ Entertainment

### TV

- **Succession S3** ‚Äì Still great! It stays consistent.
- **Gen V S1** ‚Äì Grotesque, and also very entertaining! Felt like a parody of
  X-men.
- **Loki S2** ‚Äì Finally, something good again in the MCU.
- **Scanvengers Reign S1** ‚Äì I came across a video essay on YouTube about it, I
  saw 30 secs and I had to check out the show.A fantastic sci-fi cartoon!

### Movie

- **The Marvels (2023)** ‚Äì Not a very bad movie, but not a great one either. It
  had a couple of moments of fun, but why do they set up so much around other
  characters if they end up ignoring the storyarcs?
- **The Killer (2023)** ‚Äì Excellent film. I felt like I was watching a regular
  movie, no bullshit, just a great movie that happend to be directed by David
  Fincher.
- **Howl's Moving Castle (2004)** ‚Äì Great movie! Can't believe I never saw this!
