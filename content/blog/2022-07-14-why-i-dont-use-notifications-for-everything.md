A few years ago I had notifications on for absolutely _everything_. My smart
watch and phone consistently nagging me with new messages, snaps, emails etc.,
and I really didn't think much of it, it felt normal.

Fast forward a few years, I've given up social media for privacy and security
concerns. And a added benefit for when I did was that my feeling of
<abbr title="Feat of missing out">FOMO</abbr> went away. I stopped think about
what everyone else was doing, I stopped to think that I had to share every
memorable moment with everyone. I stopped interacting with people I really had
no reason to interact or communicate with. I started to pay more attention to my
close friends and family. I feel like I've become more invested in my
relationships, it's more engaging to hear what my friends and family have been
up, instead of being told somewhere else.

Last year I started my first professional job after University at Netlife
Bergen. Where we use Slack for almost all of our communications, also with
clients. When I first started I turned on notifications for everything, even
threads I wasn't involved in, just in case I could contribute in some way. I
realized early that this meant that I would get interrupted frequently. We had a
discussion at work about not needing to respond to everything straight away all
the time. I thought it was expected that one should reply as soon as possible to
not bottleneck the whole pipeline. But then again, I used the same logic I used
when quitting social media:

_If someone needs to get a hold of me asap, they will call me directly instead
of e-mailing, messaging etc. and expecting a quick response_.

I then turned off all notifications, expect for mentions and DMs, and added a
more strict work hours schedule within Slack. This also affected my personal
life. E-mails don't get to notify me anymore, I need to actively check it.
During work hours only my closest friends and family are allowed through with
notifications, for everything else I check in manually. As of today I only have
notifications on for incoming calls, Signal, SMS, calendar and reminders. And it
works, I haven't gotten any feedback telling me that I reply slower than usual
or that I'm expected to answer faster. Should I turn off even more?

## To sum all of this up

I found that I don't need to keep up with everything all of the time. I can take
my time. I rather miss out of something than having the fear of missing out of
something.
