Just a few years ago I had notifications on for absolutely _everything_. I had
my smart watch and phone consistently nagging me with new messages, snaps,
emails etc., and I really didn't think much of it, it felt normal.

Fast forward a few years, I've given up social media for privacy and security
concerns. And a added benefit for when I did that was that my feeling of
<abbr title="Feat of missing out">FOMO</abbr> went away. I stopped think about
what everyone else was doing, I stopped to think that I had to share every
memorable moment with everyone. I stopped interacting with people I really had
no reason to interact or communicate with. I started to pay more attention to my
close friends and family. I feel like I've become more invested in my
relationships, it's more engaging to hear what my friends and family have been
up, instead of being told somewhere else.

Last year I started my first professional job out of University at Netlife
Bergen. We use Slack for almost all of our communications, also with clients.
When I first started I turned on notifications for everything, even threads I
wasn't involved in, just in case I could contribute in some way. I realized
early that this meant that I would get interrupted frequently and that I would
have a need to check everything all the time. But we had a discussion at work
about not needing to respond to everything straight away all the time. This came
as a bit of a shock to me, I thought it was expected that one should reply as
soon as possible to not bottleneck the whole pipeline. But then again, I used
the same logic I used when quitting social media:

_If someone needs to get a hold of me asap, they will call me directly instead
of e-mailing, messaging etc. and expecting a quick response_.

I then turned off all notifications, expect for mentions and DMs, and added a
more strict work hours schedule within Slack. I also took a somewhat similar
approach to my personal life. E-mails don't get to notify me anymore, it needs
to be an _"active relationship"_. During work hours only my closest friends and
family are allowed through, for everything else I have to check in manually. As
of today I only have notifications on for incoming calls, Signal, SMS, calendar
and reminders. And it works, I haven't gotten any feedback telling me that I
reply slower than usual or that they've expected me to answer faster. Maybe I
should turn off even more?

## To sum all of this up

I found that I don't need to keep up with everything all of the time. I take my
time and I consider my time valuable. I rather miss out of something than having
the fear of missing out of something.
