December, the month that feels so short since you need to do some much stuff
before the holidays. Buy stuff, visit the whole family and all your friends and
also function afterwards. I'm not complaining, I'm just stating facts 😅

## ✍️ Blog

I wrote two posts:

- [Switching to SourceHut Builds][srht_post].
- [You don't need live chat on your website][livechat_post]. Got featured on the
  frontpage of Hacker News.

## 🌐 Website

Doing `git log --since "Dec 2 2022" --until "Dec 31 2022"` shows me the
following:

- Some bugfixing for accessibility
- Added "Skip to content"-link
- Added "Reply to post"-link in RSS
- Added reading time to posts

It was a busy month so I didn't get a lot of time to tweak more stuff.

## 🎮 Gaming

I've played some more God of War: Ragnarök even though I've finished the main
campaign, and the game still delivers. There a new areas that are not accessible
before you've completed the game and I'm still loving it!

## 💪 Health

I ran my second "competitive" half-marathon, and finished 2 hours and 2 minutes!
I signed up for six more half-marathons for 2023, my goal is to beat my time for
each one 😎

Also managed to keep the running more consistently, averaging about 3 runs per
week now with an average of 17 km per week.

## 🌳 Life

I got to meet a friend for the first time, ever! I met a guy from South Africa
back in 2016 when I started playing Overwatch, and over the years we've become
good friends. He moved to Northern Ireland two years ago and just before the
holidays my SO and I went to visit him and his SO for the first time. We had a
great time, we went to Belfast, Portrush, Dunlace, Giants Causeway and
Bushmills. Hopefully we can go back again soon!

## 🎬 Entertainment

Didn't watch a lot of stuff this month, but a friend and I discovered an amazing
comedy show called Letterkenny - watching through season 1 at the moment and
laughing all the way! Also started watching Andor just before the holidays
ended.

### TV

Finished **Black Bird** &mdash; Great show, with amazing performances!

### Movies

- **Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery** &mdash; Not impressed, the first one is
  a proper detective movie - this was just a hollywood-showoff.
- **Verdens verste menneske (The Worst Person in the World)** &mdash; A
  Norwegian movie, a great watch - highly recommend!
