Have you ever experienced something like this? It is really frustrating. Why
couldn't Bob tell Alice what he actually wanted to know in the first message? He
would've gotten an answer within the first 10 minutes. And he would've saved
Alice the trouble of thinking Bob is trying to communicate something urgent.

Instead of this being a long post, I much rather tell you about
[nohello.net](https://nohello.net/en/). I usually send this to my friends and
co-workers when they start the conversation with "Hi" or "Are you there?".

Please check out [nohello.net](https://nohello.net/en/) and share it with your
friends and co-workers!
