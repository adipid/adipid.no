## ‚úçÔ∏è Blogging

I started the new year browsing the interwebs and I saw my website mentioned
randomly on a website, specifically about my logs! That's super cool! And I've
received e-mails from readers with questions, feedback and just nice things to
say! It means a lot that people find the stuff I write about interesting.

During this month I've written 7 posts, looking good for reaching the 100 days
to offload challange.

## üí™ Health

I've been running frequently again, ran another "competetive" half-marathon.
Looking forward to keeping this up!

## üå≥ Life

My focus-level has been excellent this month, been using my paper notes a lot
and it feels like I've been getting a lot done - it feels great!

## üåê Website

I cleaned up my logs a bit, I added [Deno-scripts][deno_scripts] to parse my
logs. I made my own tiny CLI for updating my logs, where for example when I'm
updating what I've watched the CLI will automatically retrieve metadata about
the movie or show.

Also added a proper sitemap to my website and restructured some pages and
sections.

## üìö Reading

I bought "Kang the Conqueror" when I was in Northern Ireland before Christmas
and finally got around to read it. It was a good comicbook which made me more
excited for the new Ant-Man movie coming in Februrary.

Also bought new book, an ebook, "Ansible for DevOps" by Jeff Geerling, hoping to
up my Ansible game. I started to use Ansible a while back, but I never did
anything other than the bare minimum. I want to create more playbooks for my
personal infrastructure so that I can version control everything. Unfortunatly
the book isn't suited for people with `arm`-based architecture,
[yet](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops/issues/404#issue-915154424).
So I haven't been able to play around with it as much as I wanted. Hopefully
soon though!

## üé¨ Entertainment

### Movies

- **Marriage Story** ‚Äì OK film about an American couple going through a divorce.
  Very American IMO.
- **I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore** ‚Äì OK film to watch, nothing
  speical.
- **Colleteral** ‚Äì A rewatch, it's been ages since my first viewing and I'm not
  sure the movie has aged that well - it felt too slow for me.

### TV

- **Letterkenny** ‚Äì Currently watching this, it's funny, but I'm not going to
  bingewatch this one.
- **The Last of Us** ‚Äì It's been really great, very impressed with the first
  three episodes even though I've played both games.
- **The Legend of Vox Machina** ‚Äì A friend of mine recommended this and I'm
  impressed, short and entertaining episodes! Watched season 1 and half-way
  through season 2.

## üéÆ Gaming

I did something strange, I bought Red Dead Redemption 2 again on PC. I moved my
gaming PC to the living room and hooked it up to the TV and connected a wireless
controller. And now I'm 10-12 hours deep into the story again! And it works
perfectly fine on the Steam Deck.

And another strange thing happend! I bought a Rougelike-game called [Dome
Keeper][dome_keeper]. I've only played it on my Steam Deck, and it works
surprisingly well! It's a great small game to kill time with.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

I've been [trying out Helix][trying_helix] this last few weeks, and it's so
nice! It's super fast, minimum config and the learning curve hasn't been that
steep.

Also updated a bunch of my Deno modules, I found out that I can use them in my
scripts for this very website so I made them more module like. You can check out
all of them here:

- [d-yr][dyr]: Access weather API, also has a CLI-tool.
- [deno-omdb][omdb]: Access OMDb movie and TV show database, also has a
  CLI-tool.
- [deno-books][deno_books]: Access OpenLibrary's API, also has a CLI-tool.
- [wcarbon][wcarbon]: Check your websites carbon emissions via the CLI.

Also been phasing out my Pinboard-account since my subscription is ending soon,
so I've been self-hosting [Linkding][linkding] for the last few weeks and I have
no complaints.
