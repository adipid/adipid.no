I recently discovered [Tom MacWright's blog][macwright], and I read some of his
blog-posts, and found one about [paper notes][macwright_notes]. I highly
recommend checking it out.

In 2018 I discovered [bullet journaling][bujo]. I've been trying to write
consistently ever since, with a somewhat success, but always miss some
months/weeks every year. I've used this to remember what I've done for specific
days, what appointments and events I'm attending or going to attend. And it
works, but I usually don't write in it everyday, I write every two or three
days, depending on how busy I've been that week.

And when it comes to notes in general, I've been trying to use my reMarkable 2
to write notes about work related stuff and other "discoveries" I come upon on
the interwebs. But I always seem to forget it when going to work and I think
it's a hassle to take in and out of my backpack and remembering to charge it.

And like Tom, I bought nice notebooks for my bullet journaling and managed to
write a lot, but suddenly I abandoned it. I never brought my bullet journal to
work or when I travelled, it was just too much of a hassle, and what if I lost
it?

Then a few weeks ago I found a Norwegian store that sells Field Notes, which fit
my back pocket perfectly, and I thought maybe I should try to keep a small
notebook with me at all time. So I bought six, because I'm going all in.

And I've written notes everyday, and I've had a blast, it just works. Whenever I
just remember something I just write it down and forget about it. In meetings I
use it for the same thing. I use it for todo-lists for the day or future. The
other day a colleague and I were going through a presentation we were preparing
for the University of Bergen and I wrote down all the comments and ideas I came
up as we were presenting for each other, instead of trying to remember all of
them in my head. And man did that work wonders! I made it into a list and we
adjusted everything and nailed the presentation!

Like Tom, I treat them as append-only, and when I started doing this, it came
naturally for me to only write down my notes in the paper notebook instead of
having to rely on a digital notebook. No more needing to organize my notes, if
it's more important and useful in a project sense I add it to its specific place
when I get time. I flip through my notes every now and then, and weirdly enough,
I started to flip through the notebook instead of checking my phone.

And now, after a week I flip through my notes and add what's interesting to my
bullet journal and keep the other stuff in the field notes. It's quick and easy,
and I don't have to spend a lot of time trying to remember what I was doing
earlier that week.

Again, I highly recommend reading [Tom's post][macwright_notes], and checking
out his [blog][macwright] in general.
