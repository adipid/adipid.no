Another month has gone by, and I don't know I feel about that! Let's wrap it up.

It's been a quiet month in terms of blogging, I just haven't found the time or
motivation to sit down and _just write_. I managed to put together the first
issue of my [Kaizen][kaizen]-series with [Kaizen #1][kaizen_1].

## üçÄ Life

Paternal leave-life is treating me nice, it still amazes me how much time I'm
able to spend time with our daughter and how important that is for us. I'm
having a great time. We managed to visit some of my family when we went to a
wedding a couple of weeks back, and it was so great having time to stay for more
than a day or two, actually having time for it.

## üí™ Health

In short I've been consisently inconsistent, but, and there is a big but, I have
managed to keep up on running, but not in a schedule. For the whole of March I
ran ~63 km. Next weekend I have another half-marathon coming up, which is going
to be interesting to see if my unscheduled schedule has paid off.

Side-note: I'm working on a way to display all my runs on the website alongside
my other logs.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

I started the month contributing to a Norwegian open source project,
[NRSS](https://github.com/olaven/NRSS), that makes all of Norway's government
funded podcasts available through open RSS-feeds instead of via an app. It's
built using Deno's Fresh, which I'm very familiar with because of [hima][hima],
[Filmpolitiet API][fp_api] and my own website, `timharek.no`. I currently have
four PRs waiting to be reviewed for NRSS.

Haven't done much to the website other than maintenance, but there are bigger
changes coming. It involves my logs and how I keep track of them. I don't want
to announce the project as it's in its early stages.

Check out the latest issue of [Kaizen #1][kaizen_1], I've also written about my
home-lab shenanigans.

## üé¨ Entertainment

### Movies

- **Wonka (2023)** ‚Äì Meh movie. Not my type of movie, but the choclate looked
  really nice.
- **Dune: Part two (2023)** ‚Äì Great movie, I felt more immersed in the
  movie-setting in this one and I liked how most of the characters from the
  previous movie got more screen-time and dialogoue.
- **Road House (2023)** ‚Äì Another meh movie. Some of the fighting was really
  cool, but the story...

### TV Shows

- **The Gentlemen S1** ‚Äì Fun, exciting, and jaw-dropping at some stages. I don't
  think I have ever seen anything like this from Guy Ritchie.
- **Pantheon S1** ‚Äì I discovered this by accident when reading comments
  somewhere. It was a really cool show that explores one of the most intriguing
  parts of humans and technology, and how that might work in the future.

Started watching **Sh≈çgun S1** this month, it's really good so far (ep7)! And
**Invincible S2** is back, and what a rollercoaster. Looking forward to
**Fallout S1** next month, from the first trailer it looks promising!
