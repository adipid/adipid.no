## ‚úçÔ∏è Blog

I managed to write a few blogposts this past month, three in English and one in
Norwegian.

- [I made a website for the place I live][place_i_live_post]
- [Privacy vs. Anonymity][privacy_post]
- [Casual gaming is getting boring][casual_gaming_post]
- [Nettsiden finnes n√• ogs√• p√• norsk][norwegian_post]

And I also translated the whole website to Norwegian using Zola's builtin i18n
support, which you can checkout in the main navigation, it works pretty great. I
haven't decided if I'm going to write all blogposts in Norwegian yet, we'll have
to see what the future holds (and what I have time for).

There is also a breadcrumbs path on my site now, which is (supposibly) on all
pages, and I've found it really useful just for myself haha.

Also added a [travel-log page](@/logs/travel.md) to my site over on my
[logs](@/logs/_index.md)-section. It's not complete, it's mainly for myself but
I thought it would be cool to share.

## üéÆ Gaming

Just the other day I came across [Northgard][northgard], a
<abbr title="Real-time Strategy">RTS</abbr> Norse Viking game, I've played a few
hours, it's been fun. But I'm really looking forward to God of War: Ragnarok
November 9th!

## üí™ Health

I've gotten back in to regular running again, averaging ~20 km every week since
my previous update, looking forward to keeping it up!

## üìö Reading

I finally finished reading [The Phoenix Project][phoenix_project], what a
roller-coaster! I enjoyed how it introduced new concepts throughout the book as
if it was regular textbook. The story was intriguing and I could really picture
what was going on at all times. I think I need to find more books like this

## üé¨ Entertainment

### TV

- She-Hulk &mdash; A big letdown, story felt rushed, it had no pace and the only
  cool thing about the show was Daredevil.
- House of the Dragon &mdash; Great show, interesting characters and intriguing
  conflicts, highly recommend!
- Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story &mdash; Great! Evan Peters nailed
  all the weird vibes!

### Movies

- Werewolf by Night &mdash; A breath of fresh air from Marvel Studios, it was a
  short film introducing us to the monsters of the
  <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr> and Ted was my favorite.
- The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! &mdash; Showed my SO a great
  old slapstick-movie, comedies was different.

Looking forward to Black Panther: Wakanda Forever in November, I really hope
Marvel Studios delivers on this one!
