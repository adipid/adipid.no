2021 is the year.

I started my official website-creation journey 12 years ago this January, and
this time I am going to keep all my posts (or at least archive them properly). I
have always had a tendency to delete everything to start over.

A proper introduction is required, I believe; My name is Tim HÃ¥rek Andreassen,
currently I am finishing my bachelors degree in Computer Security at the
University of Bergen. I care about creating solutions that respects people, in
terms of privacy, security and user experience. I have three year-old bull
terrier, called Ayla - we love going for long hikes in the mountains here in
Norway.

The reason behind this blog is for me to be able to share my findings and
experience from both the web and real life, it can be everything from sharing
useful tools, how create and do different automation tasks. I might share some
life hacks I know as well (not that I am aware that I know any as of this
writing ðŸ˜…). Though, I am certain that I will also be sharing some of my own
privacy and security tips, as this is something I find very interesting and
important.

If you ever have any questions about the blog, or to me personally, please to
not hesitate to [get in touch](/connect)!
