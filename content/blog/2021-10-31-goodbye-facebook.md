I decided to deactivate my Facebook profile this summer and I haven't looked
back. Now it's time to delete the whole account, including Messenger.

I only deactivated my profile so that I could still be reachable through
Facebook Messenger, but I've come to the conclusion that I really don't need
Messenger either. I'm now ready to say goodbye, for good.

## Why

Firstly, I must say that I respect everyone that still uses Facebook. I
understand the value of the service, but I've come to terms that it's not useful
for me anymore.

When Facebook first became popular where I'm from we used it for everything;
communication, event planning, keeping up to date with friends and family etc.
In the beginning it was all fun and innocent, but for the last couple of years
there has been the Cambridge Analytica incident (and many others[^1]) and now
just recently Facebook Inc. renaming themselves to "Meta". It doesn't provide me
with any value anymore, it's filled with ads and friends' posts about stuff we
really shouldn't care about. It has become a competition for attention and time.

Facebook is not our friend, they're a business trying to make money of our data.

## Where to reach me

I will be available through e-mail, SMS and Signal[^2] for all digital
communication.

Reach out to me by e-mail for my phone number in order to contact me on Signal.

## TL;DR

I'm putting my account up for deletion on the 5th of November 2021.
