## ✍️ Blogging

This has been a quiet month in terms of blogging, a lot is going on in my
day-to-day so I haven't prioritized writing as much I want to. Managed to put
together a short one about owning my own hardware.

## 💪 Health

Been running a bit less than January, but I'm happy nonetheless, also managed to
sneak in some strength workouts during work when I needed to catch a break. And
ran another "competetive" half-marathon.

## 🌐 Website

I added a new page, Bookmarks (removed as of July 9th 2023), which is a
collection of the bookmarks I've collected throughout the years, that I'm
storing on my own self-hosted Linkding-instance. Other than that I've made a few
bugfixes.

## 🎬 Entertainment

### Movies

- Ant-Man 3 - A letdown. The MCU is becoming stale, I was really excited for
  Kang... but I was let down, again.
- The Whale - Such a powerful movie, Brendan Fraser's performance was
  phenomenal. At the end of the movie I was sitting on the edge of my seat with
  so many thoughts and feelings flowing through my head. Everyone needs to watch
  it!
- Weird: The Al Yankovic Story - A funny and self-aware movie. I've always known
  of Weird Al's name, but I never knew what he actually was.

### TV

Finished The Legend of Vox Machina S02, a great cartoon with such likeable
characters, like Grog! Season 3 can't come soon enough!

## 🌳 Life

Lots are happening, we're started the process of selling our apartment this week
and hopefully have completed the process of putting it up for sale before
easter. So if I'm unresponsive to emails and messages etc. this month, that
might be the reason why.
