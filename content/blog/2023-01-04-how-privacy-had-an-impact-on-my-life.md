To explain how privacy had an impact on my life, I need to start from the
beginning.

## Privacy-adventure begins

NB! I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Security from the University of
Bergen. Which is basically an equivalent to a Computer Science Bachelor's with
an added emphasis on security.

I remember when I got the email saying I got accepted into Computer Security I
was a bit let down because I actually wanted to study just Computer Science. But
I thought I'd give it a go, this was at the end of summer in 2017.

Fast-forward one year, I'm taking this class which I didn't really think would
be any interesting called: _Internet Security_. I remember the first lecture, it
was about online banking, specific to Norway. How our social security numbers
work, how banking systems was flawed in the early 2000s. But then in the second
or third lecture we learned about Snowden's revelations from 2013. I always
thought I was aware of how bad foreign actors (big corporations etc.),
specifically from the US was. But I was so wrong. The revelations spanned across
two separate lectures. And immediately after the first one I started to make
some changes.

During that same semester someone close to me became really ill and I had to
move home for some time. During that time I had a lot of time to think, and I
remember I spent a decent amount of time taking actions for my online privacy
and security. My first step was to migrate my email over to ProtonMail (PM) from
Gmail. I have had an account at PM for a few years already, but never really
used it. I got a paid account with a custom domain and started using
alias-addresses for my services. But that took a toll on my ability to remember
passwords and which email alias I had used for which service. So I started using
[Bitwarden][bitwarden].

Something else I also discovered was [PrivacyGuides][privacyguides] (formerly
known as PrivacyTools) and [PrismBreak][prismbreak]. I used these sites to find
alternatives for some apps and services I was already using. I tried a lot of
them, some were bad and some were good and I still use some today.

When I was unable to find alternatives I tried to look up their policies and
read what others said about them. What were the drawbacks of using this service,
what did I give up.

I also switched from Android, my Pixel 2 to an iPhone XS, because I wanted
Google out of my life. I switched from Google Drive to Sync.com to Tresorit to
iCloud. I started using all the services from Apple since they were advertising
themselves as the privacy-conscious company...

I didn't delete any of my social media accounts before 2021, but I did start
hardening my accounts immediately after I learned all about the Snowden
revelations. I read blogposts, tutorial and guides for making sure everything
was as hardened as possible.

## Today

I still think back to what things was like before I got "paranoid" (this is
meant as joke), and I think I was ignorant for not being conscious about what,
where and how I was doing stuff online. And I'm glad that I have a more
conscious attitude on doing stuff online now.

I have since 2018 managed to get my close family and friends to start using
[Signal][signal] for our daily communications. I always vet a service before I
start using it, I use [AlternativeTo][alternativeto] to check for Open Source
alternatives I discover. I help people get started with password managers, since
I know it can be overwhelming, especially in the beginning. I stopped using
cloud-storage in 2021 and have self-hosted my own cloud at home, where I use
Nextcloud.

And to summaries what I've learned:

- I'm more conscious about what services I use.
- I read or find a TL;DR for privacy policies for new services.
- I nudge people in a more privacy-respecting direction.
- Self-hosting is awesome and takes a lot of time to just get right.
- It can look scary at first, but the result is better than the alternative.
- I try to own my own data as much as I can.

When I come to think about it I don't think it has been so inconvenient in a
sense where I just want to say "Fuck it, let's just the downsides". But I have
to admit, I'm using some services that goes against my belief of
privacy-respecting solutions. And I'm so grateful that my friends and family has
started to take an interest in why privacy (and security) is important.
