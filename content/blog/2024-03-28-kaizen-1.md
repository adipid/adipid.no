Looking back at [Kaizen #0](/blog/kaizen), I thought I was going to have posted
more by now, but I've been busy with other things. But here we are!

## timharek.no

Since the original post I have the following changelog:

- Fixed an accessibility bug with the "Skip to content"-button.
- Updated a bunch of text on a lot of pages.
- Updated my CV.
- Updated to the latest version of Deno Fresh, `v1.6.5`.
- Refactored how I parse page attributes to be validated with Zod.
- Refactored how I parse page content, simplifying and using DRY.
- Cleaned up a bunch of old types.
- Split everything that has to do with parsing links in page contents to its own
  file, `content_links.ts`.
- Removed the need to specify `taxonomies` on every post that has tags. (This
  was from the migration from Zola)
- Replaced my own implementation of slugify-ing with Deno standard library's
  `toKebabCase`.
- Renamed `date` -> `createdAt`, and `updated` -> `updatedAt` for pages and
  posts.
- Moved all Markdown-related code to `markdown.ts`.
- Fixed a performance issue where I sorted all blogposts for every loop.
- Fixed charset-validation in `sitemap.xml`.

As you can see, mostly maintenance and QOL improvements. No big new features.
But I'm however planning a bigger overhaul of how my personal logs work. The
overhaul involves SQLite ðŸ˜Ž Everything is still in the early stages.

And I know I said that I would start to use CalVer for my website, but I have
since come to the realization that's overkill and would just add more work than
what I want to maintain.

## Home lab

Not much has changed here yet, still in the planning phase for how I'm going to
utilize my Zimaboard. I think I will be able to replace most of my servers with
it, as my requirements aren't that high. My biggest challenge here is that it
will take time and I want to do it right on the first try.

### Home Assistant

The SD-card for my Home Assistant-instance died suddenly. And I had no backups,
I didn't have a lot of stuff configured. And lucky for me, my Raspberry Pi (RPi)
Zigbee HAT, [Raspbee II](https://phoscon.de/en/raspbee2), got bricked so I was
unable to set up my devices. I got everything back up again after buying a
[Conbee II](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2) USB stick instead. Things even seem
more reliable now.

I spent too long trying to figure out how to enable the GIPIO headers and
disable bluetooth on the RPi, and how I was supposed to edit the
`mnt/config.txt` or `mnt/boot/config.txt` on my MacBook. I never managed to
mount the filesystem properly, so I used my gaming PC instead. Luckily it had a
USB-C port for the dongle for the SD-card reader.

But everything worked out when I replaced the Raspbee II with the Conbee II.

### Networking

The PowerLine-setup in our new home wasn't as bullet-proof as I initially
thought. It's very unstable and whenever we turn on our washing machine the
network get halted. I thought about moving everything closer to the router-area,
but there's not enough physical space. Therefore I bought another Asus router to
use as a mesh-endpoint, and now we have better WiFi coverage and all my servers
are consistently online. And the servers maintain the advertised internet-speeds
we pay for!

## House

Since I'm staying home for my
[paternal leave](/blog/not-going-to-work-for-158-days), I've managed to sneak in
some 3D-printing for some home improvements. I started my adventure down the
really cool grid-framework [Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/). It doesn't
take too long to print, but I have to print a lot in order to get going. So far
I've spent probably 30 hours printing for two drawers, where one of them are
fully utilized and optimized.

It's going to take a while to optimize all drawers when I also want to print
other stuff in between. But hey, it's fun!

I have also added a new shelving unit (IKEA Ivar) in my home office, where one
of the shelves are for just electronics and charging them. So far this has
worked out great! Now we have a place to put away our stuff and always keep them
up to charge. I also plan to set up a smart-plug to prevent damage to the
batteries for overcharging.
