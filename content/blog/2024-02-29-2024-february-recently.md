## üçÄ Life

I'm two weeks into my paternal leave and it's going great! We have found our
rythym and the days go by fast.

This month [The Verge wrote][playdate_post] that the [Playdate][playdate] had
become available for order in Norway, so logically I bought one! I just got it
yesterday, but I'm impressed by how nice it is to use. The games are
inexpensive, and some of them are very unique. The crank is really something
else. I will hopefully write up a review at a later date, I have started working
on my thoughts in a separate blogpost already üòé

## üí™ Health

I've kept up with the running! I also bought exercise slings that I mounted
outside, which has been really nice for a quick 20 minute full body workout.

I managed to get sick so I was out of the running and exercise regime for half a
week, but I managed to go for 5 km walks every day regardless. The sickness
resulted in that I had to skip one of my half-marathon races. But I'm feeling
much better now. Next race is in March! ü§û

[Arne Bahlo][arne] posted his monthly [Home Screen for February 2024][arne_post]
and I noticed a app called [Gentler Streak][gentler_streak]. I checked it out,
and now I've been using it for two weeks ‚Äì it's a great _workout tracker_. I
love that it's not nagging about circles and keeping up the streak, it gives me
lots of details on how I'm doing health-wise in terms of sleep and exercise.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

I did a "major" refactor for [Filmpolitiet's API][fp], where I simplified a lot
of stuff. I also [wrote about it][fp_post].

Not a lot of changes has happend on the blog, yet. Like I mentioned in [Kaizen
#0][kaizen], I have more stuff planned. I also have some stuff I'm trying out in
my homelab.

I also tried out [HTMX][htmx] with [Deno Fresh][fresh], and I managed to get it
working. Not sure how I feel about the developer experience, if it's better than
using Fresh's native islands.

## üé¨ Entertainment

This has been a very quiet month in terms of entertainment.

### Movies

- **The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018)** ‚Äì Funny and interesting movie. Lots of
  great stories.
- **Erin Brockovich (2000)** ‚Äì Great movie! Can't believe I haven't watch this
  before now!

### Games

I bought [Pacific Drive][pdrive] and have managed to sneak in 7 hours of
playtime since launch. It's been fun so far, it's a bit repetetive, but
enjoyable so far. I really like how you interact with the car and world setting.

And like I mentioned earlier, I'm playing some games on the _Playdate_. Lots of
games to check out!

### Podcasts

I discovered the [localfirst.fm][localfirst], and I just started to listen to
the show. I'm interested in learning how to make local-first stuff with
[CRDT][crdt]'s and about stuff built with a local-first focus.

## üåê Links

- [Conway's law][conway] ‚Äì The link between communication structure of
  organizations and the systems they design.
- [The Gulf Between Design and Engineering / Design Systems International][gulf]
  ‚Äì Narrow the gap between design and code. And plan like a farmer, don't obsess
  about deadlines to early, take one day at the time.
- [(Still) Stalking the Wily Hacker][cliff] ‚Äì Great keynote about a security
  incident in the 80s that scientists didn't have any funding to fix. They found
  the hacker through very primitive means.
- [What bothers me about ChatGPT and A.I.][bother_ai] ‚Äì People use generative
  AIs as a solution/answer, instead of a part of the solution/answer.
- [Find time to do it right][do_right] ‚Äì Doing stuff right the first time.
- [But can you give up GitHub?][giveup_gh] ‚Äì Should we give up GitHub? I think
  we should challenge GH to open up more and to stop GH from becoming the
  Facebook of source forges.
- [A Love Letter to Tinkerable Software][tinker] ‚Äì Learning how technology works
  by tinkering and trying, instead of reading or looking up stuff. It was the
  good ol' times!
- [Why I'm skeptical of low-code][lowcode] ‚Äì Some great points on why you should
  be skeptical to low-code tools. One of the main products I work on at my
  current job was initial built with a low-code tool. We spent last year pulling
  it out of that environment in order to be more flexible and not rely on stuff
  we cannot control.
