This was a quiet month, I think. I'm still adjusting to being a parent, and it's
amazing! There are new things happening every day, and we have new things to
look forward to every day!

And a few hours after publishing my last monthly update, I went ahead and
ordered a new 3D printer, the Original Prusa i3 Mk4. Five minutes after taking
it out of the box I was already printing. With my Ender 3 S1 I think I spent
just a couple of hours looking up tutorials on how to make the bed level
properly. But with my new Prusa Mk4 it does so fully automatically. And it's so
much faster, and quieter!

## 💪 Health

Still keeping up with my running. I tried out the new watchOS feature for
running against yourself. I managed to run my 5 km route 1 minute and 15 seconds
faster. So I think I'm going to continue using that. And I have a new race
coming up late in October, another half-marathon.

## 🧑‍💻 Website

I haven't done so much this month when it comes to my website, but I managed to
add a few new pages: [More](/more) and [Subscribe](/subsribe). After moving away
from Zola to Fresh I forgot to link to some of my other pages, like my
[logs](/logs) etc. And I wanted a seperate page on how to subscribe to the blog.

I've also updated my [Uses](/uses)-page. There are some tooling that has changed
and a few updates to my actual set up.

## 🎬 Entertainment

Still watching _Ashoka_, and started watching _Succession_ this month as well.

- Succession S1 - What a great show! The family dynamic in this show is so
  intriguing and fucked up.
- Foundation S1 - I had really high hopes for this show. The first half was
  really good, but some of the acting really tore it back down. We tried to
  watch S2, but the storyline following Gaal and Sal was so boring. It's a
  shame, because the world is so interesting and Lee Pace really brought his
  great talent to this show.

Full logs are available over on my [watched](/logs/watched)-page.

## 🌐 Links

A new section. Here I want to share some links I've curated/picked up this last
month that I found interesting. Have a look!

- [git-cliff][cliff] – A customizable changelog generator. I'm eager to try this
  out for some of my own projects!
- [Vento][vento] – A new template generator, made by the same developer behind
  the static site generator Lume.
- [On Craft][on_craft] – A great read about how craft can be a form of
  communication and collaboration, instead of a weapon.
- [Style is consistent constraict][style_ango] – How style can be a (good)
  constraint on staying consistent. I even wrote up my own take on it, in
  [Style](/blog/style).
- [On Waiting][on_waiting] – "You’re guaranteed to have more information in the
  future."
- [Imba][imba] – A full-stack langauge for creating web applications. No more
  need for writing everything seperatly.
- [Making time][making_time] – "Out with the old, in with the new."
