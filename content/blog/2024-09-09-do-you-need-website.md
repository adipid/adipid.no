A follow-up to [my website journey]-post. In this blogpost I will explore the if
you actually need a website. Should or shouldn't you make a website?

Whenever I refer to "website" in this post, I'm refering to a personal website,
like the one you're reading this on or from now.

And I can start off by giving you a too long; didn't read: things you can have a
personal website for:

- Blog
- Portfolio
- A hub for your socials, like an identity hub
- CV/Resume
- "Public brain", a place where you share your notes etc., also known as a
  second brain.
- Personal promotion
- Online store where you sell stuff you've made

If you're still reading it's probably because you want to know more about these
different things you can use a website for, but first let me go more into why
you should have a website.

## Why you should have a website

It's a great way to share. It's a great way to communicate your thoughts and
ideas in a medium you like, blogposts, photos, illustrations, drawings, regular
pages and much more. It should give you an opportuinity to get people involved
in what you like and make people want to communicate with you.

You learn how to communicate your thoughts and ideas better, the more you use
your website and add stuff it, the better you become. You learn by doing.

You can show what’s unique about you. Have a website that reflects the image,
quirks, colors, and mood of your personality. You can be yourself on your own
website.

Don’t assume visitors know you already. Immediately answer the obvious
questions. Say who you are. Show what you look like. Let them quickly hear what
you sound like.

Even if you don't think you have anything to bring to table, someone else
probably thinks you do!
