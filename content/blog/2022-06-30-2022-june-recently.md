Still trying to keep this a monthly thing, like last month
([Recently May 2022](@/blog/2022-05-24-recently-may-2022.md)).

## Goals from last month

- Read at least 1 new book: Well, I guess I haven't gotten around to finishing a
  book, but I'm currently reading Ruined by Design by Mike Monteiro.
- Write at least 1 new post: [Vipps should allow usernames][vipps-post].
- Push all my existing repos to `git.wyd.no`: I pushed all repos I deemed
  apporiate.

## What I've been up to?

Discovered a new app, [Bike][bike], outliner app. I've used it to write down
quick notes for the blog and I also used it for some meetings notes. I really
enjoy writing notes with bullets, it helps me keep everything neat!

I finally managed to acquire `harek.no`, which I've tried to buy for 5-6 years.
I e-mailed the previous owner multiple times, but never got a response. I put
the myself on the watchlist for the domain one day and the following hour I got
a response that the domain would most likely be available the following week, so
I "pre-ordered" it and I eventually got it!

Every once and now I need to share my screen during meetings, virtually and in
meeting rooms. And it's important to turn of all notifications when you are
going to do so. But it's so cumbersome to go up to the top-right corner and
enable Do-not-disturb. So I thought I could create a script that does it, and to
my surprise I could just use the **Shortcuts**-app on macOS to do it, because it
also has a CLI-app that can run all your shortcuts. So now I use this to turn on
my Do-not-disturb:

```sh
shortcuts run dnd-on
```

I got my blogpost, [Vipps should allow usernames][vipps-post], published in a
Norwegian tech/developer-site [Kode24][kode24]. The company/app I criticized
even [responded][kode24-respons]. Not sure I'm so happy with their response, but
I got positive feedback from my initial post. And I think even more people are
aware of it now. Thanks to [Mathias][mathias] for suggesting that I send it to
Kode24!

Also Internet Explorer has officially been announced dead.

### Homelab

A few months ago I invested in a server-cabinet to keep my home office neat, and
I recently discovered that my Nextcloud was a bit slow. When I ran a speedtest
on it it was capped at 93.53 Mbps, which I thought was odd. I put the ethernet
cable in another slot, but it was still capped. I decided to just try and swap
the cable, and it fixed it. Apparently I had a bad CAT6 cable, I didn't know it
could become capped like it did.

I bought IKEA smart blinders for my bedroom and paired it to Home Assistant. I'm
always surprised how simple it is to set everything up, I really like having
everything under my control!

Not so much my homelab, but I managed to buy a Steam Deck! And it's amazing, it
performs excellent, the Linux experience on it is solid and it worked with my
Thunderbolt 3 dock without any configuration. I might have to write a review for
this thing, because it's amazing!

### Deno

I've created two simple CLI tools with [Deno][deno], one for using [OMDb
API][omdb_api] and one for [Website Carbon's API][wcarbon_api]. You can check
them out here, [deno-omdb][deno-omdb] and [wcarbon][wcarbon]. And to get those
CLI tools working nicely I also created a Deno module,
[deno-cli-help][deno-cli-help].

### Website: Backlinks

[Zola][zola] is close to its 0.16.0 release that would introduce backlinks! So
that one can see how pages link to one-another, I've been testing it and started
implementing support for it on my site. I've prepared all my links to work with
this new feature. I realized that all my internal links in my
`template`-directory was hardcoded, so I cleaned those up! Looking forward to
this release!

## What's next?

Because of this month's success, I guess it couldn't hurt to set some new goals
for July.

- Read at least 1 new book.
- Write at least 1 new post. I have a few in my backlog.
