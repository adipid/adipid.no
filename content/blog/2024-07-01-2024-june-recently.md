First half of 2024 has gone by, and here we are with another update for what
I've been up to since last time.

## üçÄ Life

Our daughter is reaching more and more milestones! She's growing fast, and
kindergarten is approaching. And in July I will start working again after [158
days of parental leave].

Not a lot more has happened since May. I think July with be more eventful when
we visit more family and friends in my hometown.

## üí™ Health

No race this month either, but I have been keeping a fairly good running routine
this past month! Averaging around five times a week including short sessions of
2.5 km, longer of 5 km and a longer one of 13 km during one week. It's been
great, and I manage to it in the morning after our daughter wakes up.

I also got a bike this month! Haven't been riding a lot, but I have put in 40 km
since I got the bike in the last half of June. It's a lot of fun! It's nice
being able to ride a 15 km route without using more than an hour.

I tested my Lactic acid levels and VO<sub>2</sub> in a lab while running. I
didn't plan to test this, but I was asked to take the tests in someone elses
place. I didn't have any expectations except that my VO<sub>2</sub> would be
higher than what my Apple Watch says. And to my surprise my VO<sub>2</sub> was
higher than what my watch said, it was 48.5 ml/kg/min, 2 higher than what my own
stats said. Based on my lactic acid testing I learned my threshold paces and
heart-rate for both endurance and speed. I have been using those in my running
since and have noticed improvements just after two weeks. I'm going to take
another test in 6 months time to see if I have improved, the actual testing was
really fun and encouraging!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

I have stopped working on my logging tool. I'm not sure if it actually sovled a
problem I was having. It felt like I was making an overcomplicated and complex
piece of software that would take too long to develop. Plaintext-logging is
works fine.

And I finally upgraded my homelab, and I wrote about it in [Kaizen #3].

I also got two pull requests merged for [Fresh] and [JSR.io], both of which were
for accessibility issues. I saw the issues and had the time to fix it,
[fresh#2494](https://github.com/denoland/fresh/pull/2494) and
[jsr#592](https://github.com/jsr-io/jsr/pull/592).

## üé¨ Entertainment

### Movies

- **Hit Man (2023)** ‚Äì It felt like a real movie, and the setting was really
  interesting. There were a lot of funny moments, highly recommend a watch!
- **The Antisocial Network (2024)** ‚Äì I wasn't aware that 4chan was behind so
  much of how the 'modern' internet is today, and how bad things have gotten
  because of it.

### TV

We started watching **House of the Dragon** (HotD) S2 and **The Bear S3**.
**HotD** started with some intense stuff and **The Bear** did something really
interesting in the way it started its new season. Looking forward to seeing what
these shows have in store!

- **Clarksons Farm S1‚ÄìS3** ‚Äì This is a proper feel-good show, highly recommend
  for just a casual watch!

### Books

As I published [May 2024](/blog/2024-may-recently), I finished the first entry
in [The Murderbot Diaries]-series. And now I only have a few chapters left in
the last entry. It's really good!

- **All Systems Red (2017)** ‚Äì Short, but very entertaining!
- **Artificial Condition (2018)** ‚Äì Everyone needs ART in their life!
- **Rogue Protocol (2018)** ‚Äì The intense corridors, the scanning, talking. Just
  everything!
- **Exit Strategy (2018)** ‚Äì Still intense!
- **Network Effect (2020)** ‚Äì This entry was so full of detail, like the
  previous ones, but on a different level. It had so much exciting going on!
- **Fugitive Telemetry (2021)** ‚Äì Short, and excellent ‚Äì but confusing entry
  order...
