This website will always respect your privacy. I will never collect any personal
data from you whenever you visit or use something that I have created, period.

## Open Source and privacy-focused analytics

For my analytics data, I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io), which is a
privacy focused analytics tool. If you prefer not to be part of those analytics,
I highly recommend using [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block
JavaScript.
