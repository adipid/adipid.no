## Open Source and privacy-focused analytics

For my analytics data, I use <a href="https://plausible.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Plausible</a>, which is a privacy focused analytics tool. If you prefer not to be part of those analytics, I highly recommend [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).
