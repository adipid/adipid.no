Hi, I'm Tim H√•rek Andreassen, a technologist from the west-coast of Norway that
likes to write about my learnings, design, programming, [logging](/logs),
[note-taking](/tags/note-taking) and more. I care about creating solutions that
respects people's privacy, security and user experience.

I work as a software engineer at Value Technology, where I dabble with full
stack development, architecture, accessibility and UX design.

During my spare time I learn about new technologies, write the occasional
blogpost, automate my everyday, 3D-print something I (definitely) need and hike
with my dog! üêï
