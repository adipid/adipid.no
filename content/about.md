My name is Tim H√•rek Andreassen. I'm a developer, designer, hiker and dog-person from the west coast of Norway.
I care about creating solutions that respects people, in terms of privacy, security and user experience.

I have a bachelor's degree in Informatics specializing in Computer Security from the [University of Bergen][uib].
Presently I'm working as a technologist at Netlife Design, and I'm also an IT manager for an offshore-service company, Vest Kontakt.

I spend my free time learning about new technologies, automating my everyday and going hiking with my dog, Ayla! üêï
