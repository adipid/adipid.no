My name is Tim H√•rek Andreassen. I'm a developer, designer, hiker and 
dog-person from the west coast of Norway. I care about creating solutions that
respects people, in terms of privacy, security and user experience.

I have a bachelor's degree in Informatics specializing in Computer Security 
from the University of Bergen. Presently I'm working as a technologist
at Netlife Design, and I'm also an IT manager for an offshore-service
company, Vest Kontakt.

I spend my free time learning about new technologies, automating my everyday 
and going hiking with my dog, Ayla! üêï
