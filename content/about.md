My name is Tim H√•rek Andreassen. I'm a developer, designer, hiker and dog-person
from the west coast of Norway. I care about creating solutions that respects
people, in terms of privacy, security and user experience.

I work as a technologist at Netlife Bergen, where I mostly work with full stack
development, accessibility and some UX.

I spend my free time learning about new technologies, automating my everyday and
going hiking with my dog, Ayla! üêï
