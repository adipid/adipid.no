I'm Tim H√•rek Andreassen, a technologist, developer, UX designer, hiker and
dog-person from the west coast of Norway. I care about creating solutions that
respects people, in terms of privacy, security and user experience.

I work as a developer at Value Group where I dabble with full stack development,
architecture, accessibility and UX design.

During my my free time I learn about new technologies, automate my everyday and
hike with my dog! üêï
