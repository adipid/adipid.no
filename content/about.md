My name is Tim H√•rek Andreassen. I'm a developer, designer, hiker and 
dog-person from the west coast of Norway. I care about creating solutions that
respects people, in terms of privacy, security and user experience.

I work as a technologist at Netlife Design in Bergen, where I mostly work with
full stack development, accessibility and some UX. I also have a "side-gig" as
an IT manager for a company I've worked for for the last 9 years, Vest Kontakt.

I spend my free time learning about new technologies, automating my everyday 
and going hiking with my dog, Ayla! üêï
