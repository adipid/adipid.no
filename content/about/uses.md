Inspired by what other people uses from [Uses This][usesthis], I like to read 
about what tools others use to get through their day to day.

This page contains lists of different technologies that I use, hardware,
software and services.

I don't really arrange my desk to well, I only do that occasionally. Here is 
some snapshots of my current workspace.
