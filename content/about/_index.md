I'm Tim H√•rek Andreassen, a developer, UX designer, hiker and dog-person
from the west coast of Norway. I care about creating solutions that respects
people, in terms of privacy, security and user experience.

I work as a technologist at Netlife Bergen where I mostly dabble with full stack
development, accessibility and UX design.

I spend my free time learning about new technologies, automating my everyday and
hiking with my dog! üêï
