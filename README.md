This is my personal website, made with [Zola](https://getzola.org).

It's pretty much tailored to my liking, but feel free to clone/fork this repo.

## Features

- Blog
- [CV](#cv) (Resume)
- "Uses"-page

### CV

The CV is generated from a simple JSON-file, `content/cv/cv.json`, it's loosely
based on [JSON Resume schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).

Here you can specify your experiences (work, education, voluntary etc.) and 
skills.
