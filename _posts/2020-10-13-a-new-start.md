Welcome to my site! It might be like many others, but this one is made by me, so at least there is that.

Not super sure what I will be posting here, but I suppose it will mainly be my findings of stuff I find interesting and/or tutorials that I can't find myself. Hopefully I will be able to post some "case studies" for some of my work, like how I created or designed something.

I really appreciate open source and privacy related software and hardware, so I will most likely post about that as well.
