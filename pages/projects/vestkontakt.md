I started working for VK back in 2012, as a part-time job beside senior high school. I've learned what this business inside out, as I've been part of everything from the assembly of their products to be a part of the sales process for their customers offshore, like Equinor (previously Statoil), Aker BP etc.

Throughout the years, as I've both gained more experience from my hobby projects, some freelance projects and what I've learned from UiB, it was natural for me to take it upon myself to bring their infrastructure up to the modern age.

Today, my responsibility consists mainly of providing them with IT support and services.

## New identity

In 2018, I redesigned their logo. I gave it more of a consistency than it had before, because it was using two totally different logos for the same brand, which was confusing our new customers.

I wanted to be true the original logo, so I kept the red accent to the logo, which I've always found to show that this is a Norwegian company, that it has a part of our national flag in it.

## Moving databases, e-mail provider, CRM

As with the new logo in 2018, we needed to move systems over to a new modern accounting system that we could get support for, as the one we were using had not been updated since 1991.

### Accounting

We went from our old Compact Regnskap to [Tripletex](https://tripletex.no), as this has almost all the features VK would need.

### E-mail provider

We were using an old, expensive Zimbra solution which was suffering from a lot of spam and junk mail filling our sales inbox. We used a lot of time going through a lot of spam to make sure we weren't missing any inquires.

We migrated our old solution over to Google Workspace (previously G Suite). This has solved all our problems, made it easier for us to sort our emails internally and externally and given us the power to use CRMs.

### CRM

We went from using no CRM to using Streak, the free version, where we only use it for checking who is responding to different emails and inquires. As this is a small company, it is more than sufficient for us.

## New website

In 2020 the company was sold to [Tollaksvik AS](https://tollaksvik.no), to be part of the [Saga Group](https://sagasubsea.com).

They made it possible for me to be allowed to fix and bring our website up to date! There is still some work to be done, but within Q1 of 2021, the website should be fully static instead dynamically maintained by PHP.

### Website from 2004

VK used to have a web store, that was selfhosted and maintained by a local developer.

### Website from 2012

Not much changed during those 8 years, VK removed the web store because people exploited it and made fake orders.

### Website today

Today, VK's website is simpler and much easier to understand and navigate. We've gained a lot more traffic since our redesign, our customers stays on our website on average for 2 min for new users and mainly go for our contact-page. So our redesign has been worth it.

## Project is still work in progress

I will update this case study as it progresses, I want this to reflect what I've been able to improve at Vest Kontakt AS.
