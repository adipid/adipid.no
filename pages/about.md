description: About Tim H√•rek, a developer based in Norway.
---

My name is Tim H√•rek Andreassen. I am a developer, designer, hiker and dog-person from the west coast of Norway. I care about creating solutions that respects people, in terms of privacy, security and user experience.

Currently, I am finishing my last semester of my bachelors degree in Computer Security at the University of Bergen. Where I've learned a lot of different practices in terms of development, security and privacy.

I spend my free time learning about new technologies, automating my everyday and mostly hiking with my dog, Ayla! üêï
