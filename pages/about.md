description: About Tim Hårek, a developer based in Norway.
---

My name is Tim Hårek Andreassen. I'm a developer, designer, hiker and dog-person from the west coast of Norway. I care about creating solutions that respects people, in terms of privacy, security and user experience.

Currently, I'm finishing my last semester of my bachelors degree in Computer Security at the University of Bergen. Where I've learned a lot of different practices in terms of development, security and privacy.

I spend my free time learning about new technologies, automating my everyday and mostly going hiking with my dog, Ayla! 🐕
