I will never collect any personal data from you, whenever you visit or use something that I've created, period.

For my analytics data, I use <a href="https://plausible.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Plausible</a>, which is a privacy focused analytics tool.

Also, my website is open source - you can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/timharek/timharek.no" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
