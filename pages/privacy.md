I will never collect any personal data from you, whenever you visit or use something that I have created, period.

For my analytics data, I use <a href="https://plausible.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Plausible</a>, which is a privacy focused analytics tool. If you prefer not to be part of those analytics, I highly recommend [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/).

Also, my website is open source - you can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/timharek/timharek.no" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.
