Hi, I'm Tim Hårek; a developer 👨‍💻, dogperson 🐕 and hiker 🏔. I'm currently a Computer Security student at the University of Bergen, where I also work as an IT assistent, helping students and lecturers. I also have a 2nd part-time job as an IT manager for an offshore-service company, [Vest Kontakt](https://vestkontakt.no), where I assist in "every" aspect of IT whenever they need me.

I mostly work with automating my everyday needs through scripting, but I also enjoy web development every now and then.

FYI: I'm a privacy advocate, so I won't collect any data from you when you visit my site, period.
