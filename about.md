Hi, I'm Tim Hårek; a developer 👨‍💻, dog-person 🐕 and hiker 🏔. I'm currently a Computer Security student at the University of Bergen, where I also work as an IT assistent, helping students and lecturers. I also have a 2nd part-time job as an IT manager for an offshore-service company, <a href="https://vestkontakt.no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vest Kontakt</a>, where I assist in "every" aspect of IT whenever they need me.
